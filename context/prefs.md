# Research Preferences & Filters

Guidelines that override general knowledge and shape what gets included in daily updates.

## What to prioritize
- Shipped product changes over announcements
- User-facing features over infrastructure
- Pricing/accessibility changes
- Product removals or deprecations

## What to filter out
- Pure marketing announcements without product changes
- Opinion pieces without product signals
- Speculation or rumors
- Non-product news (funding, org changes, etc.)

## Sources to trust
- Official product blogs and changelogs
- Public documentation updates
- Verified launch posts from tracked people
- Reputable tech/product news when tied to shipped products

## Tone and style
- Factual, not promotional
- Focus on "what changed" not "what's cool"
- Connect changes to user problems and product decisions
