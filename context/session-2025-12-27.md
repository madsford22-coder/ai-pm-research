3. **tooling/prompts/daily-research.md**
   - Comprehensive prompt for AI research assistant
   - Includes instructions for checking recent posts from tracked people
   - Defines output format and quality bars

### RSS Feed Discovery

**RSS feeds found and added for 12 people:**
- Shreyas Doshi: https://shreyas.io/rss (verify URL)
- Gibson Biddle: https://gibsonbiddle.com/feed (verify URL)
- Lenny Rachitsky: https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/feed

## Daily Research Update: 2025-12-27

### Items Included

1. **Lenny Rachitsky - AI Tools Overdelivering Survey Results**
   - Source: https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/p/ai-tools-are-overdelivering-results
   - Published: Dec 24, 2025
   - PM relevance: Survey data on AI tool productivity and product-market fit
   - Connects to open questions: User expectations, retention patterns

2. **Microsoft - Anthropic Claude Models Added to Foundry Platform**
   - Source: https://partner.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/article/azure-updates-december-2025
   - Product change: Multi-model platform strategy
   - Connects to open questions: Build vs buy patterns

### Research Process Notes

- Used `check-recent-posts.py` to find recent posts from tracked people
- Found Lenny Rachitsky had multiple recent posts (Dec 20-27)
- Only Lenny had posts in the last 7 days from tracked people
- Most other tracked people either don't post frequently or posts are older than 7 days
- Company product updates were limited today - mostly general industry news that didn't meet quality bar

---

## Key Decisions & Patterns

### Research Approach
- Focus on shipped product changes, not announcements
- Prioritize posts from tracked people that explain real product decisions
- Filter through quality bar: must answer all 4 synthesis questions
- Accept "No meaningful updates" as valid outcome

### RSS Feed Strategy
- Use Puppeteer script to discover feeds automatically
- Mark feeds as "verify URL" when discovered programmatically
- Some people use newsletters (Substack) which have RSS feeds
- Some people primarily use Twitter/X - may need different tracking approach

### Tooling Philosophy
- Scripts should be runnable independently
- Output should be in formats useful for both humans and AI
- Scripts should handle errors gracefully and report what was checked

---

## Open Items & Next Steps

### RSS Feeds to Verify
- Several RSS feeds marked "verify URL" - should be tested to confirm they work
- Some people may need manual RSS feed discovery (Ravi Mehta, Julie Zhuo, etc.)

### People Without RSS Feeds
- Consider adding Twitter/X API integration for people who primarily post there
- Some people may need to be tracked differently (e.g., newsletter-only, podcast-only)

### Research Process Improvements
- Consider expanding search beyond 7 days for people who post less frequently
- May need to check company blogs more systematically (not just web search)
- Consider adding automated checking of company changelogs/update pages

### Daily Research Workflow
1. Run `check-recent-posts.py` to get recent posts from tracked people
2. Search for product updates from tracked companies
3. Filter through quality bar in prefs.md
4. Synthesize items using required format
5. Create daily update file

## Git Status

All changes committed and pushed to:
- Repository: https://github.com/madsford22-coder/ai-pm-research
- Branch: main
- Latest commit: bcfeecb (Add check-recent-posts.py and update daily research prompt)

---

## Notes for Future Sessions

- The system is now fully operational
- RSS feed discovery worked well - found 12 feeds automatically
- Daily research process validated - found 2 PM-relevant items today
- Quality bar is working - filtered out low-signal content appropriately
- Consider adding more people to track if signal is too low
- Consider expanding company list if needed for more daily updates
