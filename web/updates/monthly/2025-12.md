# December 2025 Research Summary

Meta paid $2B to acquire agentic AI capabilities rather than build them internally. Meanwhile, Microsoft's CEO publicly admitted Copilot's integrations "don't really work." These moves reveal how companies are handling the gap between AI product promises and reality.

The pattern across December: companies are course-correcting. Vercel removed 80% of their agent's tools to improve reliability. OpenAI is exploring ads in ChatGPT conversations. The early rush to ship AI features is giving way to harder questions about what actually works and how to pay for it.

## What Matters

- **Build vs. buy is shifting toward acquisition.** Meta's $2B purchase of Manus shows platform companies betting that buying agentic capabilities beats building them. The acquisition brought millions of paying users and working agent infrastructure - faster than internal development could deliver.
- **Honest product assessment enables faster iteration.** When Microsoft's CEO told managers that Copilot integrations "don't really work," it signaled a shift from glossing over AI product failures to fixing them. Leadership acknowledging what's broken helps teams stop investing in features that hurt adoption.
- **AI products are testing new business models.** OpenAI exploring ads in ChatGPT conversations shows the subscription-only model may not be sustainable. This changes product tradeoffs - prioritizing advertiser content in AI responses could break user trust even as it unlocks revenue.
