# January 2026 Research Summary

AI coding tools are expanding beyond engineering teams. Product leaders are showing how PMs can use these tools for their own workflows - not just to understand what engineers are building, but to build things themselves.

Meanwhile, companies are moving from AI experiments to production systems, sharing real implementation patterns that actually work at scale.

## What Matters

- **PMs are building with AI tools now.** Lenny's guides show how non-technical PMs are using Claude Code and Cursor to ship features without waiting on engineering.
- **Real agent systems in production.** LangChain's Remote case study reveals practical patterns for multi-agent customer onboarding that handles 1000+ users.
- **The shift from experimentation to deployment.** Companies are sharing what actually works when you move AI from proof-of-concept to production scale.
