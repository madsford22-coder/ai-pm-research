# January 2026 Research Summary

The infrastructure for production agents arrived this month. Microsoft launched Windows 365 for Agents with dedicated VMs and enterprise identity, GitHub released the Copilot SDK to embed agentic workflows into any app, and LangChain shipped template libraries that deploy agents in hours instead of weeks. The shift isn't "can we build agents?"—it's "how do we operate them at scale?"

Meanwhile, real-world usage revealed critical patterns. Vercel's empirical tests showed SQL agents achieving 100% accuracy versus bash's 53% for GitHub queries, but hybrid approaches matched SQL's accuracy by adding verification layers. Remote's case study demonstrated how to handle datasets too large for context windows: let LLMs reason, let code execute. And Lenny's analysis of ChatGPT apps positioned them as a decade-scale distribution opportunity—users don't search for apps, the model suggests them based on conversation context.

## What Matters

- **Agent infrastructure became enterprise-ready.** Microsoft's Windows 365 for Agents runs autonomous AI on isolated VMs with cryptographic identities and audit trails—addressing the compliance concerns blocking enterprise adoption. GitHub's Copilot SDK lets developers embed the same agentic execution loop powering Copilot CLI into any application, handling planning, tool invocation, and context management. LangChain's template library includes seven ready-to-deploy agents (calendar briefs, email triage, incident response) plus access to 8,000 tools via MCP Gateway. The pattern: platforms are commoditizing agent infrastructure so teams can focus on domain-specific tools and user experience.

- **Architecture choices determine agent effectiveness—and cost.** Vercel benchmarked three agent architectures on GitHub issue queries: SQL achieved 100% accuracy at $0.51 and 45 seconds, while bash managed only 53% accuracy at $3.34 and 401 seconds—7x more tokens, 6.5x higher cost, 9x slower. But a hybrid SQL-plus-bash verification layer also hit 100% accuracy, revealing that verification layers may justify their token cost when accuracy matters. Remote's customer onboarding agents solved the context window problem differently: LLMs reason about data transformations, then sandboxed Python code executes them—keeping datasets out of context entirely and virtually eliminating hallucinations for sensitive payroll data.

- **Non-technical PMs can now build and ship products directly.** Meta PM Zevi Arnovitz demonstrated building production-ready products using Cursor without an engineering background, using multi-model strategies (Claude for planning, Gemini for UI) and AI peer review between models. Teresa Torres built a custom markdown-based task management system in Claude Code with automated research digests and writing partnership workflows. The capability shift is real: sometimes building yourself is faster than writing specs and waiting for engineering resources. This changes the PM-designer-engineer triangle and raises questions about junior PM career paths when AI handles the tasks they used to learn on.

## Essential Resources

1. **Lenny Rachitsky** — [Why Your Product Stopped Growing: 5-Step Framework](https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/p/why-your-product-stopped-growing) — Systematic approach to diagnosing growth bottlenecks through segmentation, avoiding the trap of jumping to solutions before understanding the actual problem.

2. **Vercel** — [Empirical Test: Is Bash Really All You Need for Agents?](https://vercel.com/blog/testing-if-bash-is-all-you-need) — Controlled benchmark comparing SQL, bash, and filesystem agents with real numbers on accuracy, cost, and latency—revealing when hybrid verification layers justify their overhead.

3. **LangChain** — [Remote Case Study: Multi-Agent Customer Onboarding](https://www.blog.langchain.com/customers-remote/) — Production architecture for handling datasets too large for LLM context windows through hybrid reasoning-plus-code execution, reducing migration time from days to hours.
