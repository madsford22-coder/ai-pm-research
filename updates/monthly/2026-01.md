# January 2026 Research Summary

Agent infrastructure crossed the production threshold this month. Companies moved from "can we build agents?" to "how do we deploy them safely at scale?" Vercel shipped sandboxes for secure code execution, Microsoft launched dedicated cloud VMs for autonomous agents, and LangChain documented the context management patterns that make long-running agents actually work.

Beyond infrastructure, we're seeing the first clear patterns for how PMs work with these tools. Non-technical PMs are building and shipping products with Cursor. ChatGPT apps emerged as a decade-scale distribution opportunity. And the uncomfortable truth surfaced repeatedly: engineering velocity is accelerating faster than PM work, making product management the new bottleneck.

## What Matters

- **Context management became a solved problem.** LangChain documented three strategies for the "dumb zone"—when context windows fill and models degrade: spawn isolated subagents that return only final results (67% token reduction in some cases), store context externally in memory systems, or actively compress as you go. Remote's production case study showed the pattern in action: separate LLM reasoning from code execution when datasets exceed context windows, letting models plan transformations while Python handles the actual data processing in sandboxed WebAssembly. For PMs building agents that run longer than 30 minutes, you need one of these approaches.

- **Distribution is shifting to conversational surfaces.** ChatGPT apps represent what Lenny calls a "decade-scale opportunity" comparable to the 2008 App Store launch—but with fundamentally different economics. Adobe, DoorDash, Canva, Figma, and Spotify already launched. The model automatically suggests apps based on conversation context; users don't search or browse. Tool descriptions function like a new SEO layer—what Lenny calls "AEO" (Agent Experience Optimization). For products that solve problems people describe in natural language, a ChatGPT app may deliver more distribution value than traditional marketing spend.

- **Agent security infrastructure reached enterprise-grade.** Microsoft's Windows 365 for Agents provides isolated VMs with cryptographic identity (no passwords), audit trails, and Intune management—the compliance baseline enterprises will expect from any agent platform. Vercel Sandboxes went GA with <100ms cold starts for Node.js and Python, enabling production code execution without building your own isolation layer. GitHub's Copilot SDK embeds the same agentic execution loop powering their CLI into any application via Node.js, Python, Go, or .NET. The pattern: don't build agent infrastructure yourself—use platform primitives and differentiate on domain expertise.

## Essential Resources

1. **Vercel** — [Sandboxes reach GA with production-ready code execution](https://vercel.com/blog/vercel-sandbox-is-now-generally-available) — Secure isolated environments that let agents run untrusted code safely, solving the core constraint of agent code execution at infrastructure level.

2. **Lenny's Newsletter** — [Marc Andreessen: The real AI boom hasn't started yet](https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/p/marc-andreessen-the-real-ai-boom) — Argues we're pre-1995 internet, not post-2000 bubble, with 10-20 year deployment timelines favoring infrastructure investment over feature races.

3. **LangChain** — [Remote case study: Multi-agent customer onboarding at 1000+ users](https://www.blog.langchain.com/customers-remote/) — Shows hybrid reasoning-plus-code execution pattern for datasets exceeding context windows, separating LLM planning from Python execution in WebAssembly.
