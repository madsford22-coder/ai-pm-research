# January 2026 Research Summary

The agent infrastructure moment arrived in January. Microsoft shipped Windows 365 for Agents with enterprise-grade VM isolation, GitHub released the Copilot SDK to embed agentic execution loops in any app, and LangSmith's Agent Builder reached GA with no-code agent creation. The shift from "can we build agents?" to "how do we deploy and scale them?" is complete.

Meanwhile, AI coding tools became genuine PM productivity infrastructure. Non-technical PMs built shipping products using Cursor. Teresa Torres demonstrated terminal-based Claude Code workflows for custom task management. The pattern: AI assistants are moving from conversation partners to embedded workflow systems.

## What Matters

- **Distribution channels are reorganizing around AI conversation.** Lenny's analysis shows ChatGPT apps getting contextual discovery—users don't search for apps, the model surfaces them based on conversation intent. Adobe, Canva, Figma, DoorDash, and Spotify already launched. This isn't App Store 2.0; it's fundamentally different economics. Marketing spend matters less; tool descriptions become the new SEO. For PMs, the question shifts from "how do we get discovered?" to "how do we describe our capability so AI recommends us?"

- **Agent infrastructure reached enterprise readiness.** Microsoft's Windows 365 for Agents provides isolated VMs with cryptographic identity and audit trails. GitHub's Copilot SDK embeds battle-tested execution loops in Node.js, Python, Go, and .NET. LangSmith Agent Builder deploys no-code agents with permission gates and feedback learning. Remote's production case study shows hybrid reasoning-plus-code execution handling 1000+ customer migrations. The pattern: platforms now provide the hard parts (planning, context management, security)—differentiate on domain tools instead.

- **Context management became the critical constraint.** Teresa Torres explains models degrade as context fills—LangChain calls it the "dumb zone." ChatGPT containers persist packages to avoid reinstall friction. LangChain's subagent pattern isolates work in separate contexts, claiming 67% token reduction. Vercel's bash-vs-SQL benchmark showed SQL achieving 100% accuracy at 7x lower cost specifically because relational queries avoid context bloat. For PMs building AI features, the architectural question is: how do you keep context lean while preserving capability?

## Essential Resources

1. **Lenny's Newsletter** — [ChatGPT apps: The next great distribution channel](https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/p/chatgpt-apps-are-about-to-be-the) — Why contextual discovery in conversation represents a decade-scale opportunity comparable to the App Store launch.

2. **GitHub** — [Copilot SDK: Build an agent into any app](https://github.blog/news-insights/company-news/build-an-agent-into-any-app-with-the-github-copilot-sdk/) — How to embed GitHub's agentic execution loop in Node.js, Python, Go, or .NET with planning, tool invocation, and context management handled.

3. **LangChain** — [Remote case study: Multi-agent customer onboarding](https://www.blog.langchain.com/customers-remote/) — Production architecture separating LLM reasoning from code execution to handle datasets larger than context windows.
