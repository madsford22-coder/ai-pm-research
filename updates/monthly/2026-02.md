# February 2026 Research Summary

February marks a shift from "can we build agents?" to "how do we operate them at scale?" Microsoft's enterprise survey reveals agent deployment depends more on organizational readiness than technical capability—requiring new roles, executive sponsorship, and human oversight by design. Meanwhile, Perplexity doubles research speed and Vercel ships Git workflows for non-developers, showing that latency and accessibility now matter as much as capability.

The month's secondary theme: AI tools teaching PMs to think differently. Teresa Torres explains why context degrades in long conversations (it's architecture, not bugs), Lenny demonstrates MCPs automating meeting prep without manual prompting, and Dr. Becky's parenting frameworks map directly to product leadership under uncertainty.

## What Matters

- **Agent operations emerges as a discipline.** Microsoft's survey identifies five practices that separate successful agent deployments from failures: executive sponsorship (not just technical approval), clearly scoped high-ROI use cases (reducing email response from 4 hours to 30 minutes, not vague "productivity"), human-in-the-loop by design (approval before critical actions), dedicated agent roles (trainers, monitors, coordinators sitting between IT and business), and measuring behavior change (users delegated 40% of meeting prep) over technical metrics (95% accuracy). GitHub embeds agents into CI/CD pipelines for autonomous code maintenance—generating tests, updating docs, handling style fixes without developer intervention. The pattern: agents require ongoing management, not set-and-forget deployment.

- **Speed crosses the adoption threshold.** Perplexity's 2x faster Deep Research (from minutes to sub-minute) changes whether users substitute the agent for manual research versus just complement it—latency determines if tools replace workflows. Vercel's v0 redesign adds Git workflows (branches, PRs, merges) through visual interfaces, enabling non-developers to contribute production code in the same review process developers use. Earmark's two-person team automates meeting transcription and drafting while preserving human judgment for editing and relationship management. The shift: agents move from "interesting demo" to "replaces manual work" when fast enough and accessible enough to fit existing workflows.

- **Context management shapes product architecture.** Teresa Torres documents "context rot"—AI quality degrading at 50-70% of context capacity, well before token limits—explaining why ChatGPT and Claude force session resets. Products must choose: long-running sessions (preserve context, risk rot) or frequent resets (lose continuity, maintain quality). Lenny's MCP walkthrough shows agents autonomously updating CRM and preparing briefs by connecting directly to organizational systems—not just chatting about them. The pattern: conversational AI isn't just better prompts; it's architectural decisions about session boundaries, context compression, and system access.
