# February 2026 Research Summary

AI product management shifted from theoretical frameworks to practical skill-building this month. Lenny Rachitsky dominated the conversation with three concrete guides: how to train AI product sense through deliberate practice, how to automate PM workflows using Model Context Protocol servers, and how parenting psychology maps to product leadership under uncertainty. Meanwhile, GitHub's agentic Copilot capabilities and Vercel's production-ready Sandboxes proved that autonomous agents are moving from experimentation to daily workflows.

The meta-pattern: AI product sense isn't something you wait to develop—it's trainable through specific practices you can start today. The tools (MCPs, agentic workflows) are production-ready; the constraint is learning how to use them effectively.

## What Matters

- **AI product sense is a trainable skill, not accumulated wisdom.** Lenny's framework breaks it into five concrete practices: active experimentation (use AI products daily and deliberately break them), pattern recognition (compare how ChatGPT vs. Perplexity vs. Notion AI handle context differently), understanding one layer deeper (know why context limits force agents to spawn subagents), shipping volume (rapid small features build judgment faster than planning), and studying post-mortems. The shift from "get more experience" to "practice specific skills" means new PMs can accelerate learning without waiting years.

- **MCPs transform AI from chat interface to workflow automation.** Lenny demonstrates using Model Context Protocol servers to automate meeting prep (agent pulls calendar, researches attendees, generates briefs automatically) and CRM updates (agent extracts action items from meetings and updates HubSpot without manual logging). The architectural difference: MCPs provide *write access* to organizational systems, not just read/query capabilities. For PMs evaluating AI tools, the decision tree simplifies: does it support MCP? If yes, you can automate workflows. If no, you're limited to assisted chat.

- **Leadership under uncertainty requires the same skills across domains.** Dr. Becky Kennedy's parenting frameworks map directly to product decisions: emotional regulation provides stability when stakeholders panic, the "I believe you AND" pattern validates feelings while maintaining boundaries (better than "but" which negates or pure empathy which avoids accountability), and reframing "the feature failed" versus "I failed as a PM" prevents shame spirals that block learning. These aren't soft skills—they're operational frameworks for high-stakes decisions with incomplete information.
