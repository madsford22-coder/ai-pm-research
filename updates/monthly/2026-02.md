# February 2026 Research Summary

February revealed how agent infrastructure is maturing from experimental tooling to production systems—but the real story is about memory and workflow automation, not just better models. LangChain documented how they built memory systems that let agents learn from corrections across sessions, Vercel added 69,000+ agent skills and video generation to their infrastructure, and GitHub embedded agents directly into CI/CD pipelines. The shift isn't "agents can do more tasks"—it's "agents are becoming operational infrastructure that improves through use."

PMs are navigating a gap between AI capability and actual practice. Lenny's survey showed most PMs use AI for research and prototypes, not production deployment—despite tools promising end-to-end feature shipping. The friction isn't technical; it's trust, organizational readiness, and the maintenance burden of AI-generated systems.

## What Matters

- **Memory systems transform agents from stateless tools to learning assets.** LangChain's Agent Builder memory architecture stores user corrections as structured knowledge, retrieves relevant patterns through semantic search, and applies learned behaviors across sessions—without model retraining. The implementation details matter: memory isn't raw conversation logs but extracted insights (key-value pairs, entities, preferences) that agents query when similar contexts appear. Perplexity's "agentic memory" takes this further—actively changing research strategy per user based on accumulated patterns, not just recalling facts. For PMs, this changes the product model: agents become sticky because users invest in training them, creating switching costs beyond feature parity.

- **Infrastructure choices determine agent capabilities more than model quality.** LangChain improved Terminal Bench performance from Top 30 to Top 5 through "harness engineering"—adding self-verification loops and trace-based debugging—without changing the underlying model. Vercel's 69,000+ agent skills marketplace and video generation infrastructure (Grok Imagine Video, Kling, Veo, Wan) show agent capability expanding through composable services, not just bigger models. GitHub's Agentic Workflows embed agents into CI/CD for automated issue triage and documentation updates—the infrastructure integration matters more than the agent's reasoning capability. The pattern: optimize how agents interact with their environment (tools, feedback, memory) before waiting for GPT-6.

- **Enterprise agent adoption blocked by observability, governance, and security—not capability.** Microsoft's survey showed 80% of Fortune 500 companies deployed active AI agents, but three gaps limit scale: teams can't see what agents do (observability), don't know who controls them (governance), and worry about prompt injection attacks (security). Lenny's enterprise readiness checklist reinforces this—SOC 2, SSO, RBAC, and audit logs aren't nice-to-have; they're table stakes for procurement. The operational patterns emerging: dedicated agent trainer, monitor, and coordinator roles sitting between IT and business teams. For PMs building agent products, solving these three gaps is how you win enterprise deals, not just demonstrating agent accuracy.
