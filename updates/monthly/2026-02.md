# February 2026 Research Summary

February revealed AI product development collapsing from months to hours through two mechanisms: systematic skill-building and multi-model orchestration. Lenny Rachitsky documented how "vibe coding" emerged as a paid job category—StrongDM's 3-person team ships production features by describing intent to AI tools, not writing code. Meanwhile, Perplexity's Council Mode demonstrated multi-model orchestration as the new architecture: different models handle different subtasks, routing work based on complexity rather than defaulting to one expensive model for everything.

The operational reality came into focus too. Microsoft's enterprise survey identified five practices that separate successful agent deployments from failures, while Teresa Torres explained "context rot"—why AI conversations degrade predictably as they lengthen. The pattern: AI product success requires understanding both the capabilities (what's possible now) and constraints (why sessions reset, why quality degrades).

## What Matters

- **Vibe coding as organizational pattern, not experiment.** StrongDM hired non-engineers to ship production features using Claude Code and Cursor—no traditional coding required. Their 3-person AI team includes a former sales engineer, a product manager, and a designer. They shipped customer dashboards and internal tooling in 1-3 weeks each. The architecture enables this: features are isolated with API boundaries, AI-friendly tech stacks (React, PostgreSQL), and engineering review gates prevent coupling to core systems. This isn't prototyping—it's production software development with a 2-4 hour build cycle.

- **Multi-model orchestration beats model loyalty.** Perplexity's Council Mode routes research tasks to different models based on their strengths—chairman coordinates, specialists execute, Opus 4.6 handles complex reasoning. The economics work: use cheap models for simple subtasks, expensive only where needed. This validated what LangChain documented in January: deep agents spawn subagents to prevent context rot and manage complexity. For PMs, the question shifted from "which model?" to "how do we orchestrate models?"—routing strategy becomes product architecture.

- **AI product sense through comparative analysis, not passive use.** Lenny operationalized skill-building: test two AI products on identical tasks for one week, document quality differences, identify architectural choices. The exercises build intuition faster than years of casual usage. Compare ChatGPT versus Perplexity on research tasks—Perplexity spawns subagents for breadth, ChatGPT does single-context depth. The meta-skill: recognize patterns in one product and apply them elsewhere. Microsoft's survey validated this at enterprise scale: successful agent deployments require dedicated roles (trainers, monitors, coordinators) who understand agent behavior, not just ship features.

## Essential Resources
