# February 2026 Research Summary

February marked the shift from AI as chat interface to AI as workflow infrastructure. Lenny's MCP demonstration showed agents autonomously updating CRMs and preparing meeting briefs—no manual prompting required—while Vercel's Sandbox GA and Microsoft's Q2 results confirmed that agent infrastructure is now production-ready, not experimental.

Meanwhile, Dr. Becky's interview revealed something unexpected: the frameworks for managing ambiguity, setting boundaries, and emotional regulation transfer directly from parenting to product leadership. These aren't separate skillsets—they're the same operational patterns applied to different contexts.

## What Matters

- **MCPs turn agents from assistants into autonomous workers.** Lenny's walkthrough showed meeting prep and CRM updates happening automatically through Model Context Protocol servers that connect directly to calendars, CRMs, and docs. The pattern: agents now have write access to your systems, not just read access. This means they can observe workflows and execute updates without manual prompting—pulling meeting details from Google Calendar, generating pre-meeting briefs, and logging action items to HubSpot autonomously. For PMs evaluating AI tools, the question changed: does it integrate via MCP? If yes, workflow automation is possible. If no, you're stuck with chat.

- **Emotional regulation is leadership infrastructure, not soft skills.** Dr. Becky described regulation as "the most sturdy leader within you can stay connected to yourself even amidst other people's distress." In product contexts: when stakeholders panic about timelines or competitors, regulated leaders provide stability. Her "I believe you AND" framework—validating feelings while maintaining boundaries—resolves PM conflicts more effectively than pure empathy ("I understand") or pure authority ("Just do it"). Example: "I believe this deadline feels impossible AND we need to ship by Friday" creates space for both acknowledgment and accountability.

- **Agent infrastructure reached production maturity.** Vercel Sandboxes went GA for secure code execution in production environments. Microsoft's Q2 earnings showed AI revenue growth exceeding decades-old products. The pattern: companies aren't experimenting with agents anymore—they're deploying them. Stripe built an app in 5 hours using v0. Sensay shipped an AI memory companion in 6 weeks with two developers. The infrastructure for autonomous agents is here; the question is what workflows to automate first.
