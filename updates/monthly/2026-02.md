# February 2026 Research Summary

February marked the shift from "AI assistants" to "AI coworkers"—with companies like StrongDM hiring people specifically to "vibe code" (ship production features without traditional coding skills) and Perplexity orchestrating multiple specialized models like a team rather than relying on one all-purpose AI. The infrastructure is production-ready: Microsoft's enterprise survey revealed the five practices that make agent deployments actually work, while new organizational roles emerged—agent trainers, monitors, and coordinators who sit between IT and business teams.

For PMs, the month's signal is clear: the question isn't "can AI tools help?" but "how do we architect products and organizations to support AI-native workflows?" StrongDM's 3-person AI team ships features in 1-3 weeks by isolating functionality with strong boundaries. Perplexity routes subtasks to specialized models based on cost-quality tradeoffs. The pattern: successful AI adoption requires deliberate architectural choices, not just better prompts.

## What Matters

- **"Vibe coding" as legitimate job category.** StrongDM created a 3-person team that ships production features without traditional coding—just describing intent to AI tools like Cursor and v0, iterating on outputs, and validating results. The team includes a former sales engineer, a product manager, and a designer (none with development backgrounds), shipping customer-facing dashboards and internal automation in 1-3 weeks per project. The constraint: features must be isolated from core systems with strong API boundaries. The economic insight: this works when iteration speed justifies technical debt and business value outweighs code elegance.

- **Multi-model orchestration over single-model loyalty.** Perplexity's Council Mode uses different AI models for different research subtasks—a "chairman" model coordinates task decomposition while specialized models handle execution based on their strengths. This validates orchestration strategies over picking one model for everything: use cheap models for simple tasks, expensive ones only where complex reasoning matters. The pattern extends beyond research: any AI product with varied task complexity benefits from routing rather than uniform model application.

- **Agent deployment requires new operational practices.** Microsoft's enterprise survey identified five critical success factors: executive sponsorship (not just technical capability), clearly scoped high-ROI use cases (not vague "improve productivity"), human-in-the-loop by design (approval gates build trust), dedicated agent operations roles (trainers, monitors, coordinators), and measuring behavior change (users delegating 40% of meeting prep) over technical metrics (95% accuracy). The emergence of agent operations as a job function signals agents need ongoing management, not set-and-forget deployment.
