# February 2026 Research Summary

February marked a shift from "can AI do this?" to "how do humans work alongside AI systems?" Engineers are becoming "sorcerers" who ship production code by describing systems to AI rather than implementing them. Organizations are discovering that AI product development isn't about learning new skills—it's about applying familiar PM practices (continuous discovery, assumption testing, rapid experimentation) to new constraints like context windows and model orchestration.

The infrastructure supporting this shift is maturing fast. Multi-model orchestration (Perplexity's Council Mode), standardized connectors (MCPs for workflow automation), and production-ready sandboxes signal that agents are moving from experimental prototypes to operational systems requiring dedicated roles and practices.

## What Matters

- **Skill shifts revealing new job categories.** StrongDM pays people to "vibe code"—describe features to AI, iterate on outputs, and ship production software without traditional coding. Lenny's 93,000-line project with Claude Opus 4.6 and GPT-5.3 Codex demonstrates this isn't just faster implementation; it's operating at a higher abstraction layer where engineers architect through conversation rather than syntax. The question for PMs: at what scale does the maintenance burden of AI-generated code outweigh shipping speed advantages?

- **Context engineering as applied PM craft.** Teresa Torres maps continuous discovery practices directly to AI context management: user interviews become prompt engineering, assumption mapping becomes model limitation testing, continuous feedback becomes trace analysis. This reframes AI product work from "learn ML engineering" to "apply existing PM skills to context window constraints." LangChain's sandbox patterns (tool-based versus environment-based) reveal infrastructure choices that determine agent capabilities—architectural decisions PMs must understand, not just delegate to engineering.

- **Multi-model orchestration replacing model loyalty.** Perplexity's Council Mode uses specialized models for different research subtasks rather than one general model for everything. Microsoft's enterprise survey shows 80% of Fortune 500 deploying active agents but blocked by observability, governance, and security gaps. The pattern: successful AI products require orchestration strategies (when to use which model) and operational practices (dedicated agent monitors, trainers, coordinators) that PMs must design alongside features.
