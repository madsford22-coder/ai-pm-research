# February 2026 Research Summary

February marked the shift from "can we build agents?" to "how do we operate them at scale?" GitHub embedded agents directly into CI/CD pipelines for automated repository maintenance, while Microsoft's enterprise survey revealed that 80% of Fortune 500 companies now run active AI agents in production. The bottleneck isn't technical capability anymore—it's organizational readiness, infrastructure choices, and understanding which parts of workflows deserve automation versus which require human judgment.

Meanwhile, a quieter pattern emerged around skill transformation. Lenny documented "engineer-sorcerers" who ship production systems by describing desired outcomes to AI rather than writing implementation details, while StrongDM created a 3-person "vibe coding" team that ships features without traditional coding. These aren't edge cases—they're early signals of how AI tools are creating new job categories between "write code" and "describe requirements."

## What Matters

- **Agent infrastructure moved from prototype to production standard.** GitHub's Agentic Workflows automate issue triage, PR reviews, and documentation updates directly in CI/CD—not as separate tools but as part of the development pipeline itself. Vercel's Sandboxes reached GA with security isolation for production agent execution. LangChain documented the two fundamental patterns for agent-sandbox integration (tool-based versus environment-based), revealing architectural choices that determine agent capabilities and failure modes. The shift: agents are operational infrastructure now, not experiments.

- **Organizations need new roles and practices to deploy agents successfully.** Microsoft's enterprise survey identified five critical patterns: executive sponsorship matters more than technical capability, start with scoped high-ROI use cases (like reducing email response time from 4 hours to 30 minutes), design human-in-the-loop approval gates from the start, create dedicated agent operations roles (trainers, monitors, coordinators), and measure behavior change instead of just technical metrics. The emergence of agent operations as a distinct job function signals that agents require ongoing management—they're not set-and-forget automation.

- **AI tools collapsed development timelines while creating new skill categories.** Lenny's "engineer-sorcerers" analysis showed engineers shipping 93,000 lines of production code through conversation with AI rather than traditional implementation. StrongDM's 3-person AI team builds customer-facing features in 1-3 weeks using "vibe coding"—describing desired outcomes to tools like Cursor and v0, then iterating on AI-generated outputs. The pattern works when features are architecturally isolated, stacks are AI-friendly (React, REST APIs, PostgreSQL), and quality gates include engineering review. This isn't just faster coding—it's a fundamental shift in what "building software" means.

## Essential Resources

1. **GitHub** — [Automate Repository Tasks with GitHub Agentic Workflows](https://github.blog/ai-and-ml/automate-repository-tasks-with-github-agentic-workflows/) — Detailed implementation guide for embedding AI agents into CI/CD pipelines to handle issue triage, PR reviews, and documentation updates autonomously.

2. **Microsoft** — [Agents Are Here: Is Your Company Prepared?](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/worklab/agents-are-here-is-your-company-prepared) — Enterprise survey revealing five practices that distinguish successful agent deployments (executive sponsorship, scoped use cases, human-in-the-loop design, dedicated operations roles, behavior-focused metrics) from failed ones.

3. **Lenny Rachitsky** — [Engineers Are Becoming Sorcerers: The Skill Shift](https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/p/engineers-are-becoming-sorcerers) — Analysis of the "engineer-sorcerer" phenomenon where builders ship production systems through conversation with AI rather than traditional coding, including real examples like 93,000 lines generated with Claude Opus 4.6 and GPT-5.3 Codex.
