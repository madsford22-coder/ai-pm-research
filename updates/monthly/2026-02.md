# February 2026 Research Summary

February marked a critical transition from "can we build agents?" to "how do we actually run them?" Perplexity doubled Deep Research speed and revealed multi-model orchestration patterns. Microsoft surveyed enterprises deploying agents and identified five practices that separate success from failure. Teresa Torres explained why AI conversations degrade predictably—not a bug, but an architectural constraint that shapes product design.

The month's work clarified practical constraints PMs face daily: context windows fill up and quality drops, latency determines whether agents replace manual work, and organizational readiness matters as much as technical capability.

## What Matters

- **Multi-model orchestration beats model loyalty.** Perplexity's Council Mode uses different specialized models for different subtasks—a "chairman" model coordinates while Opus 4.6 handles complex reasoning. This isn't about picking the best model; it's about routing tasks efficiently. Cheap models for simple work, expensive ones where reasoning matters. For PMs, the shift: stop asking "which model?" and start asking "how do we orchestrate multiple models based on task complexity?"

- **Agent deployment requires new organizational roles.** Microsoft's survey found successful deployments need dedicated agent trainers, monitors, and coordinators—roles that sit between IT and business teams. Technical capability alone doesn't drive adoption. Companies that measure behavior change ("users delegated 40% of meeting prep") iterate faster than those tracking only accuracy metrics. The pattern: agents aren't set-and-forget; they require ongoing operations like any production system.

- **Context rot is architectural, not fixable.** Teresa Torres documented how AI quality degrades at 50-70% of context capacity—well before hitting token limits. This explains why ChatGPT and Claude force session resets. For conversational AI products, the question isn't whether to handle long conversations, but how to structure sessions through summarization, subagent spawning, or external memory. Users expect AI to remember everything; product design must work around this constraint without breaking the illusion.
