# February 2026 Research Summary

February revealed the operational constraints that shape AI product design. Teresa Torres documented why ChatGPT forces session resets and Claude needs Projects—not as UX preferences but as architectural necessities to combat context degradation. Meanwhile, Lenny's coverage of MCPs and v0's Git workflows showed AI moving from "answer questions" to "do the work," with standardized protocols enabling agents to autonomously update CRMs and open pull requests.

The month also surfaced frameworks for building judgment in this shifting landscape. Lenny's synthesis on AI product sense and Dr. Becky's leadership principles provided concrete practices—active experimentation, pattern comparison across products, emotional regulation under pressure—that translate directly to PM craft.

## What Matters

- **Context windows aren't infinite, and that shapes everything.** Teresa Torres revealed that AI quality degrades around 50-70% of context capacity, not at the limit—explaining why every major conversational AI product implements session boundaries or Projects features. Models lose coherence because the attention mechanism must compare every new token against all previous tokens, diluting relevance as history grows. For PMs, this means the question isn't "should we handle long conversations?" but "at what conversation length do we reset, summarize, or spawn subagents?" Measure your typical conversation lengths in tokens and test where degradation occurs.

- **MCPs shift AI from chat interface to workflow infrastructure.** Lenny documented how Model Context Protocol servers enable agents to autonomously prep meetings by reading calendars and update CRMs after calls—no manual prompting required. This differs from traditional integrations because MCPs provide *write access* to organizational systems, not just query capabilities. Vercel's v0 demonstrated the pattern extending to development workflows: non-developers can now create Git branches, open pull requests, and merge code through visual interfaces that preserve developer quality bars like code review and merge checks.

- **AI product sense develops through deliberate practice, not osmosis.** Lenny's framework identified five trainable practices: use AI products daily but critically (push edge cases, observe failures), compare how different products solve similar problems (ChatGPT vs. Perplexity context management), understand one layer deeper than necessary (tokenization, embeddings), ship small AI features rapidly to build judgment, and study post-mortems. Dr. Becky's interview added the meta-skill: emotional regulation as leadership infrastructure—staying connected to yourself while others panic about deadlines or competitors.
