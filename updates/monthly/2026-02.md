# February 2026 Research Summary

February revealed the gap between AI coding hype and reality—most PMs use these tools for research and prototypes, not shipping production features. Meanwhile, infrastructure providers like GitHub and LangChain doubled down on agent frameworks, arguing that better models still need orchestration layers for production deployment. The tension: tools promise autonomous development, but actual practice shows hesitation to trust AI-generated code in customer-facing systems.

The month also surfaced practical PM frameworks: Teresa Torres mapped continuous discovery practices to AI context engineering, showing familiar patterns apply to new constraints. And Lenny documented "vibe coding" as an emerging job category where non-technical builders ship software by describing intent rather than writing implementation—validating AI-native development as a real organizational shift, not just better tooling.

## What Matters

- **PMs prototype with AI but don't ship production code.** Lenny's community survey shows most PMs use AI coding tools (Claude Code, Cursor, v0) for research scripts and throwaway prototypes—not customer-facing features. They build to test hypotheses and validate concepts, then hand AI-generated code to engineers for review and rewrite. The confidence gap: PMs can't reliably assess when AI output is production-ready, and organizational barriers (engineering teams prefer their own code) prevent solo shipping. This grounds the "vibe coding" narrative in reality—AI accelerates exploration, not deployment.

- **Agent frameworks remain essential despite model improvements.** LangChain defended frameworks by arguing models handle reasoning while frameworks handle orchestration, state management, observability, and safety—infrastructure models can't provide. GitHub's Agentic Workflows validated this by embedding agents directly into CI/CD pipelines for automated issue triage, PR reviews, and documentation updates. The pattern: production agents need more than smart models—they need robust infrastructure for continuous operation, error handling, and debugging.

- **Context engineering is PM craft applied to new constraints.** Teresa Torres showed that managing AI context windows maps directly to continuous discovery practices: assumption testing becomes model limitation testing, user interviews become prompt engineering, continuous feedback becomes trace monitoring. The reframe matters because it positions AI product work as familiar PM discipline under new constraints (token limits, attention dilution, context rot) rather than entirely new skills. For PMs intimidated by AI technical requirements, this reveals they already have the core competencies—just applied differently.
