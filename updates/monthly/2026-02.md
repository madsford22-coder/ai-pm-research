# February 2026 Research Summary

The month revealed a fundamental shift: AI agents moving from "interesting prototypes" to "production infrastructure requiring operational discipline." Companies stopped asking "can we build agents?" and started wrestling with "how do we operate them at scale?"—exposing gaps in observability, memory systems, and organizational readiness that determine whether agents ship or stall.

Meanwhile, the gap between AI capability and human practice widened. Tools promised autonomous development; reality showed PMs using AI for research and prototypes, not production deployment. The trust barrier matters more than the technology barrier.

## What Matters

- **Memory transforms agents from stateless utilities into learning systems.** LangChain's Agent Builder remembers corrections and preferences across sessions—agents that improve through usage, not just better prompts. This creates switching costs: users invest in training agents to their workflow, making personalized agents stickier than generic ones. The product question shifts from "what should we build?" to "how do we design feedback loops that teach useful patterns versus accumulating noise?"

- **Infrastructure, not models, determines agent performance.** LangChain improved Terminal Bench rankings from Top 30 to Top 5 without changing models—pure harness engineering (self-verification loops, trace-based debugging). Vercel launched 69,000+ agent skills and video generation through AI Gateway, validating multimodal infrastructure as table stakes. The build-vs-buy calculus flips: instead of "should we support video?" PMs ask "which video models through which infrastructure?"

- **Enterprise deployment requires organizational infrastructure, not just technical capability.** Microsoft's survey shows 80% of Fortune 500 use active AI agents, but three gaps block wider deployment: observability (seeing what agents do), governance (who controls them), and security (preventing abuse). GitHub embeds agents into CI/CD for autonomous code maintenance. Success depends on operational readiness—dedicated agent operations roles, human-in-the-loop approval gates, and behavior-change metrics—not just shipping the feature.

## Essential Resources

1. **LangChain** — [How to Use Memory in Agent Builder](https://blog.langchain.com/how-to-use-memory-in-agent-builder/) — Agents that remember corrections and preferences across sessions, transforming from stateless tools into learning systems users invest in training.

2. **Microsoft** — [Agents Are Here: Is Your Company Prepared?](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/worklab/agents-are-here-is-your-company-prepared) — Survey reveals five practices distinguishing successful agent deployments: executive sponsorship, scoped use cases, human-in-the-loop design, dedicated operations roles, and behavior-change metrics.

3. **Lenny Rachitsky** — [How PMs Are Actually Using AI Coding Tools](https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/p/community-wisdom-how-pms-are-using) — Survey shows PMs use AI for research and prototypes—not production features—revealing the gap between tool capability and actual adoption patterns.
