# February 2026 Research Summary

February marked a shift from "can AI build this?" to "how do we operate what we built?" GitHub embedded agents directly into CI/CD pipelines for autonomous repository maintenance. StrongDM created a three-person team that ships production features through "vibe coding"—describing systems to AI rather than writing code. And Microsoft's enterprise survey revealed that 80% of Fortune 500 companies now run production agents, but organizational readiness—not technical capability—determines success.

The infrastructure layer separating experiments from production systems became clearer. LangChain defended agent frameworks as essential production infrastructure despite model improvements, arguing that orchestration, state management, and observability remain necessary regardless of reasoning capability. Teresa Torres mapped familiar PM practices (assumption testing, continuous feedback, rapid experimentation) directly to context engineering—showing that managing AI constraints requires craft, not just technical knowledge.

## What Matters

- **Sorcery as a real job category, not a meme.** StrongDM pays people to "vibe code"—describe features to AI, iterate on outputs, ship production software without traditional coding. Lenny's 93,000-line project demonstrated Claude Opus 4.6 and GPT-5.3 Codex handling different parts of the codebase (scaffolding vs. algorithm-heavy logic), while GitHub's Agentic Workflows now automate issue triage, PR reviews, and documentation updates directly in CI/CD. The skill shift is real: engineers operate at architectural abstraction rather than implementation detail.

- **Agent infrastructure demands new organizational roles and practices.** Microsoft's enterprise survey identified five critical patterns: executive sponsorship matters more than technical capability, human-in-the-loop builds trust faster than autonomy, and dedicated agent operations roles (trainers, monitors, coordinators) now sit between IT and business teams. Perplexity's Council Mode orchestrates multiple specialized models rather than relying on one general model, validating multi-model architectures as production patterns—not just technical experiments.

- **Context engineering is applied PM craft with familiar constraints.** Teresa showed that user interviews map to prompt engineering, assumption testing maps to model limitation validation, and continuous feedback maps to production trace analysis. Context rot—quality degradation as conversations lengthen—isn't a bug but an architectural constraint shaping product design. LangChain's sandbox patterns (agent-controlled vs. environment-based) determine capabilities, security models, and cost structures, revealing that infrastructure choices matter as much as model selection.
