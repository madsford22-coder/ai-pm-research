# Daily PM Research Update: 2026-01-22

## Summary

Two PM-relevant signals today: Microsoft's GitHub Copilot SDK launch enables developers to build AI agents into any application, expanding agent distribution beyond GitHub's ecosystem, and Teresa Torres's case study on building healthcare AI for physicians reveals concrete trust-building patterns for high-stakes AI products. Both provide actionable insights for PMs building AI products.

## Items

### Microsoft - GitHub Copilot SDK Launch
**Source:** https://github.blog/news-insights/company-news/build-an-agent-into-any-app-with-the-github-copilot-sdk/

**tl;dr:** Microsoft launched GitHub Copilot SDK, enabling developers to build AI agents into any application. Expands Copilot beyond GitHub's ecosystem to third-party tools.

**What changed:** Microsoft released SDK allowing developers to integrate GitHub Copilot agents into external applications and tools.

**PM Takeaway:**
Platform SDKs expand AI agent distribution by enabling third-party developers to integrate agents into their own products.

**User problem impacted:**
Developers need to integrate AI coding assistance into their existing tools and workflows without building agents from scratch.

**Product surface area:**
GitHub Copilot SDK - third-party integration capabilities, agent embedding tools, and developer platform extensibility.

**Decision this informs:**
Whether to build SDKs for third-party agent integration versus keeping agents within first-party products, and how to expand agent distribution through developer ecosystems.

**Pattern to note:**
AI platforms launching SDKs to enable third-party agent integration, expanding distribution beyond first-party products similar to how APIs enabled platform ecosystems.

### Teresa Torres - Building AI for Physicians at Healio: When Trust is Everything
**Author:** Teresa Torres (Product Discovery Coach; Continuous Discovery Habits author)
**Source:** https://www.producttalk.org/when-trust-is-everything-building-ai-for-physicians-at-healio/

**tl;dr:** Teresa Torres published case study on building AI for physicians at Healio, revealing trust-building patterns for healthcare AI products.

**What changed:** Published case study demonstrating trust-building practices for high-stakes AI products in healthcare.

**PM Takeaway:**
Healthcare AI products require explicit trust-building patterns and physician involvement throughout development to address high-stakes decision-making.

**PM problem addressed:**
PMs building high-stakes AI products need concrete trust-building frameworks and validation methods to ensure professional acceptance.

**How to apply:**
- Involve domain experts (physicians, etc.) throughout AI product development
- Design validation workflows that maintain professional judgment and accountability

**Decision this informs:**
How to structure trust-building for high-stakes AI products, when to involve domain experts in development, and what validation patterns work for professional users.

**Pattern to note:**
Product discovery experts sharing healthcare AI case studies as high-stakes domains require different trust-building approaches than consumer AI products.

## Daily Product Reflection Challenge

### How to Build Trust in High-Stakes AI Products

Teresa Torres's case study on Healio's physician AI emphasizes that high-stakes domains require explicit trust-building patterns and deep professional involvement. For your AI product, how do you identify when your use case is "high-stakes" enough to require additional trust-building investments, and what are the tradeoffs between development speed and the rigor needed to earn professional trust?
