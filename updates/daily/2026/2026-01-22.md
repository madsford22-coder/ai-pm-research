# Daily PM Research Update: 2026-01-22

## One-Line Summary

GitHub releases SDK to embed Copilot's agentic core into any app, while Healio's case study reveals that physicians wanted AI for empathy—not diagnostics—upending assumptions about healthcare AI.

### Microsoft/GitHub - Copilot SDK: Embed Agentic AI in Any Application
**Source:** https://github.blog/news-insights/company-news/build-an-agent-into-any-app-with-the-github-copilot-sdk/
**Credibility:** High (first-party announcement, technical preview available now)

**What happened:** GitHub released the Copilot SDK in technical preview—a programmable layer that embeds the same agentic execution loop powering GitHub Copilot CLI into any application. Available for Node.js, Python, Go, and .NET.

**Key capabilities:**
- **Planning & execution**: Automated task planning with multi-turn workflows
- **Tool invocation**: Invoke custom tools and commands within agent flows
- **File editing & command execution**: Agents can modify files and run system commands
- **Multi-model support**: Use different AI models for different steps
- **MCP server integration**: Full Model Context Protocol support
- **Persistent memory**: Infinite sessions with intelligent context compaction

**Example code (TypeScript):**
```typescript
import { CopilotClient } from "@github/copilot-sdk";
const client = new CopilotClient();
await client.start();
const session = await client.createSession({ model: "gpt-5" });
await session.send({ prompt: "Hello, world!" });
```

**Why it matters for PMs:**
This is Microsoft's platform play for agents. Instead of building agents from scratch, developers can embed a battle-tested execution loop into their own products. The SDK abstracts away planning, tool invocation, and context management—the hard parts of agent development. For PMs building AI features, this changes the build-vs-buy calculus significantly.

**Critical questions:**
- Requires GitHub Copilot subscription or bring-your-own API key—what's the total cost structure?
- "Technical preview" status means breaking changes—when is production-ready?
- MCP support is notable—how interoperable is this with other MCP-enabled tools (like Work IQ)?

**Action you could take today:**
If you're planning agent features, prototype with the Copilot SDK before building from scratch. The execution loop, context management, and tool invocation are solved problems—focus your effort on domain-specific tools instead.

### Teresa Torres/Product Talk - Healio Case Study: When Trust is Everything
**Source:** https://www.producttalk.org/when-trust-is-everything-building-ai-for-physicians-at-healio/
**Credibility:** High (detailed case study with specific practices, physician feedback integrated)

**What happened:** Product Talk published a case study on building AI for physicians at Healio. The core insight: surveying 300 healthcare professionals revealed physicians didn't primarily want AI for diagnostics—they wanted help with "patient communication and empathy."

**Key trust-building patterns:**

**1. Research upended assumptions:**
They expected diagnostic assistance to be the primary need. Survey data showed physicians wanted communication help. This discovery reshaped the entire product direction.

**2. Citation-centric design:**
Physicians won't trust black-box answers. Healio designed citations with subscripts, hover states, and progressive disclosure so physicians could verify sources. Trust = transparency about provenance.

**3. Hybrid search architecture:**
They combined lexical search, vector search, and semantic search across multiple sources (primarily PubMed). No single approach; credible sources + multiple retrieval methods.

**4. Multi-layer evaluation:**
Eight LLM judges evaluate safety, accuracy, faithfulness, and clarity. But critically: "physician feedback trumps LLM feedback in high-stakes medical contexts." Human experts remain the final arbiter.

**5. Privacy guardrails:**
HIPAA compliance plus input guardrails that mask personal health information before processing.

**Why it matters for PMs:**
The research insight is the headline: assumptions about what physicians need were wrong. This validates early, broad user research—especially in high-stakes domains where user mental models differ from builder assumptions. The citation design pattern is transferable to any domain where users need to verify AI outputs.

**Critical questions:**
- They used 8 LLM judges—what's the latency and cost impact of multi-layer evaluation?
- "Physician feedback trumps LLM feedback"—but how do you scale physician review as usage grows?
- Citation-centric design adds UX complexity—when is it worth the tradeoff?

**Action you could take today:**
For high-stakes AI features, add citation/source transparency to your design requirements. If you can't explain where an answer came from, users in professional contexts won't trust it. And challenge your assumptions with early user research—what you think users want may be wrong.

## This Week's Pattern

**Platform SDKs replacing custom agent development.** GitHub Copilot SDK lets you embed agentic capabilities without building the execution loop. LangChain's Agent Builder (Jan 21) provides templates. The pattern: differentiate on domain-specific tools and context, not core agent infrastructure.

## Reflection Prompt

Healio's research revealed physicians wanted AI for "patient communication and empathy"—not diagnostics. Their assumptions about user needs were fundamentally wrong.

**For your AI product:** What assumptions are you making about what users want AI to help with? How would you discover if those assumptions are wrong before building?
