### Notion - AI Breakthrough Through Simplification
**Source:** https://venturebeat.com/infrastructure/why-notions-biggest-ai-breakthrough-came-from-simplifying-everything

**tl;dr:** Notion achieved better AI outcomes by simplifying LLM implementations, removing complex schemas and code generation in favor of straightforward approaches. Shows how reducing complexity improves AI product reliability.

**What changed:** Notion engineers simplified their AI implementation, removing advanced code generation and complex schemas that were causing reliability issues.

**PM Takeaway:**
Simplifying AI implementations often delivers better outcomes than complex approaches, especially when initial complexity causes reliability problems.

**User problem impacted:**
Users need reliable AI features that work consistently, not complex implementations that fail unpredictably.

**Product surface area:**
Notion AI - LLM implementation architecture, moving from complex to simple approaches for better reliability.

**Decision this informs:**
Whether to simplify existing AI implementations vs. adding complexity to improve capabilities, and how to balance sophistication with reliability.

**Pattern to note:**
Product teams simplifying AI implementations after initial complexity suggests over-engineering is common in early AI product development.
