### LangChain - Choosing the Right Multi-Agent Architecture
**Source:** https://www.blog.langchain.com/choosing-the-right-multi-agent-architecture/

**tl;dr:** LangChain published guide on choosing multi-agent architectures, covering when multi-agent systems are necessary and four main patterns. Shows how to design multi-agent systems effectively.

**What changed:** LangChain released guide on multi-agent architecture patterns and decision frameworks.

**PM Takeaway:**
Multi-agent architectures require different design patterns than single-agent systems, with tradeoffs between patterns.

**User problem impacted:**
Developers need frameworks for deciding when to use multi-agent systems and which architecture patterns to choose.

**Product surface area:**
LangChain multi-agent frameworks, agent orchestration patterns, and multi-agent system design tools.

**Decision this informs:**
When to build multi-agent versus single-agent systems, which multi-agent patterns to use, and how to structure agent interactions in complex systems.

**Pattern to note:**
AI infrastructure companies sharing architecture patterns as agent systems move beyond single-agent use cases to complex multi-agent workflows.
