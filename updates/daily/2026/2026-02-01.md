### Lenny Rachitsky - Dr. Becky on Parenting Principles That Apply to Product Leadership
**Source:** https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/p/dr-becky-on-the-surprising-overlap
**Credibility:** High (detailed interview with clinical psychologist and parenting expert)

**What happened:** Lenny interviewed Dr. Becky Kennedy, clinical psychologist and author, on surprising overlaps between parenting and product leadership. The core insight: both roles require managing uncertainty, setting boundaries, and helping others navigate ambiguity.

**Key leadership patterns:**

**Emotional regulation as leadership infrastructure:**
Leaders who can't regulate their own emotions create chaos for their teams. Dr. Becky describes regulation as "the most sturdy leader within you can stay connected to yourself even amidst other people's distress." In product contexts: when stakeholders panic about timelines, competitors, or user feedback, regulated leaders provide stability.

**The "I believe you AND" framework:**
Validate feelings while maintaining boundaries. Example: "I believe this deadline feels impossible AND we need to ship by Friday." This differs from "but" (which negates) or pure empathy (which avoids accountability). The pattern works for user feedback, team conflicts, and stakeholder pushback.

**Reframing failure as information:**
Dr. Becky distinguishes between "I am a failure" and "I had a failure." Product parallel: "The feature failed" versus "I failed as a PM." The former invites learning; the latter triggers shame spirals that prevent improvement.

**Managing ambiguity through boundaries:**
Both parenting and product work involve making decisions with incomplete information. Dr. Becky's approach: set clear boundaries ("This is what we're doing"), acknowledge uncertainty ("I don't have all the answers"), and stay open to feedback ("Tell me how this is working").

**Why it matters for PMs:**
These aren't soft skills—they're operational frameworks for high-stakes decision-making under uncertainty. The "I believe you AND" pattern alone resolves most PM conflicts more effectively than pure empathy or pure authority. For PMs managing teams, stakeholders, or user relationships, these patterns provide concrete alternatives to default behaviors.

**Critical questions:**
- How do you practice emotional regulation when the stakes are genuinely high (layoffs, pivots, public failures)?
- When does validation ("I believe you") become enabling poor performance versus building trust?
- What's the boundary between "managing ambiguity well" and "indecisiveness disguised as openness"?

**Action you could take today:**
Next time a teammate or stakeholder expresses frustration, try the "I believe you AND" framework instead of "but" or pure agreement. Notice whether it creates space for both validation and accountability. Practice this pattern until it becomes automatic.

## This Week's Pattern

**Leadership frameworks transcending domains.** Dr. Becky's parenting principles (emotional regulation, "I believe you AND", reframing failure) map directly to product leadership challenges. The pattern: high-quality decision-making under uncertainty requires the same skills regardless of context—managing emotions, setting boundaries, and helping others navigate ambiguity.

## Reflection Prompt

Dr. Becky describes emotional regulation as "the most sturdy leader within you can stay connected to yourself even amidst other people's distress."

**For your leadership practice:** Think about the last time a stakeholder or teammate panicked about a deadline, competitor move, or user feedback. How did you respond? Did you absorb their emotion, dismiss it, or provide regulated stability? What would change if you could stay connected to yourself while acknowledging their distress?
