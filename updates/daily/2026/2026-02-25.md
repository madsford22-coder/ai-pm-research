## This Week's Pattern

Last week's pattern continues: **Infrastructure and tooling determining agent reliability.** Previous updates documented memory systems (Feb 20-23), harness engineering (Feb 18-19), and sandbox architecture (Feb 11-12). No new signals emerged today that extend or challenge these patterns.

The Microsoft/GitHub post on multi-agent workflow failures may warrant future attention if it reveals novel failure modes or success patterns not covered in previous agent workflow documentation (Feb 13-14).

## Reflection Prompt

**Prompt for the week:** The past week revealed how memory systems transform agents from stateless tools to learning systems (Feb 20-23), while enterprise adoption is blocked by observability, governance, and security gaps (Feb 12). LangChain showed harness engineering matters more than model improvements (Feb 18-19).

**For your agent roadmap:** If you're building agents, which infrastructure layer is your biggest gap right now—memory (agents that learn from corrections), observability (seeing what agents do), or security/governance (controlling agent actions)? And which gap blocks your next deployment milestone?
