# Daily PM Research Update: 2026-01-11

## Summary

Two PM-relevant signals today: Lenny Rachitsky's analysis of lessons from deploying 50+ AI products at OpenAI and Google reveals concrete deployment patterns and failure modes, while LangChain's post on traces as documentation shows how observability differs for AI systems. Both provide actionable insights for PMs building AI products.

### Lenny Rachitsky - Lessons from Deploying 50+ AI Products at OpenAI and Google
**Author:** Lenny Rachitsky (Former PM at Airbnb; Newsletter author)
**Source:** https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/p/what-openai-and-google-engineers-learned

**tl;dr:** Lenny Rachitsky published analysis of what OpenAI and Google engineers learned from deploying 50+ AI products. Reveals concrete patterns, failure modes, and deployment strategies for AI product development.

**What changed:** Published comprehensive analysis of AI product deployment lessons from engineers at OpenAI and Google.

**PM Takeaway:**
Deploying AI products requires specific patterns and strategies distinct from traditional software deployment.

**PM problem addressed:**
PMs need concrete deployment patterns and failure mode awareness for AI products beyond general software practices.

**How to apply:**
- Study deployment patterns from successful AI product launches
- Understand common failure modes in AI deployments

**Decision this informs:**
How to structure AI product deployment, what failure modes to anticipate, and which deployment patterns to prioritize.

**Pattern to note:**
Product leaders sharing deployment learnings as AI product development matures beyond early experimentation.

### LangChain / LangSmith - Traces as Documentation for AI Systems
**Source:** https://blog.langchain.com/in-software-the-code-documents-the-app-in-ai-the-traces-do/

**tl;dr:** LangChain published post explaining how traces document AI systems differently than code documents traditional software. Shows why observability and debugging require trace-based approaches for AI products.

**What changed:** LangChain released blog post on trace-based documentation and observability for AI systems.

**PM Takeaway:**
AI systems require trace-based observability since decision logic happens at runtime, not in code.

**User problem impacted:**
Developers need trace-based debugging and observability for AI systems where decisions happen at runtime.

**Product surface area:**
LangSmith observability platform, trace collection and analysis, and debugging tools for AI applications.

**Decision this informs:**
How to structure observability for AI products, what debugging tools to prioritize, and how documentation differs for AI vs. traditional systems.

**Pattern to note:**
AI infrastructure companies building observability tools that recognize AI systems require different debugging approaches than traditional software.

## Daily Product Reflection Challenge

### How to Design Observability for AI vs. Traditional Systems

LangChain's post emphasizes that AI systems require trace-based observability since decision logic happens at runtime in the model, not in static code. For your AI product, how do you design observability and debugging systems that capture runtime decision-making while maintaining the same debugging effectiveness as traditional code-based systems?
