# Daily PM Research Update: 2026-02-28

## Analysis

After reviewing today's collected data against the last 14 days of updates and the quality bar in `context/prefs.md`, no items met the criteria for inclusion:

**People Activity:**
- **Simon Willison**: Posts on "Agentic Engineering Patterns" guide series—already noted Feb 24 as introductory content lacking concrete implementation details
- **Sam Altman**: Sora update—video generation infrastructure extensively covered Feb 20-21; "Abundant Intelligence" post is philosophical essay without product decisions
- **Geoffrey Litt, Gene Kim, Marty Cagan, Teresa Torres**: Archived content, book/workshop listings, or tag pages without new insights

**Company Updates:**
- **Microsoft-OpenAI**: Partnership statement—business announcement without product changes (explicitly filtered per prefs.md)
- **Google**: Image generation endpoint deprecation—infrastructure notice without product implications
- **GitHub Copilot**: "What's new" post recaps existing features (multi-file editing, Extensions) already covered in previous updates
- **Vercel**: Community management case study lacks concrete metrics or novel patterns; Queues and Telegram adapter are infrastructure features
- **Microsoft Research**: CorpGen paper on multi-task agents—research without clear product implications (deprioritized per prefs.md)

**Deduplication Check:**
All potentially relevant items either:
1. Covered topics already analyzed in depth in previous 14 days (video generation Feb 20-21, agentic patterns Feb 18-24, enterprise readiness Feb 12-22)
2. Lacked concrete details, metrics, or novel insights
3. Fell outside PM-relevant scope per `context/prefs.md` filters (research papers, partnership announcements, marketing content)

## This Week's Pattern

Last week's pattern continues: **Infrastructure and tooling determining agent reliability.** Previous updates documented memory systems (Feb 20-23), harness engineering (Feb 18-19), sandbox architecture (Feb 11-12), and observability-evaluation connections (Feb 23). No new signals emerged today that extend or challenge these patterns.

## Reflection Prompt

**Prompt for the week:** The past week revealed how memory systems transform agents from stateless tools to learning systems (Feb 20-23), while enterprise adoption is blocked by observability, governance, and security gaps (Feb 12). LangChain showed harness engineering matters more than model improvements (Feb 18-19).

**For your agent roadmap:** If you're building agents, which infrastructure layer is your biggest gap right now—memory (agents that learn from corrections), observability (seeing what agents do), or security/governance (controlling agent actions)? And which gap blocks your next deployment milestone?
