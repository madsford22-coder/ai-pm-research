# Daily PM Research Update: 2026-02-28

## Analysis

After reviewing today's collected data against the last 14 days of updates and the quality bar in `context/prefs.md`, no items met the criteria for inclusion:

**People Activity:**
- **Lenny Rachitsky**: Post on Cisco president AI interview (Feb 26)—executive commentary without product details, covered Feb 26-27
- **Marty Cagan**: Event listings and book sales pages—marketing content without product substance
- **Teresa Torres**: Archive posts and category pages—no new 2026 content with concrete PM frameworks
- **Sam Altman**: Sora update blog posts—no concrete product changes, pricing details, or feature specifications; already noted Feb 26-27
- **Geoffrey Litt**: Archive posts from 2025—outside date range for new content
- **Simon Willison**: Blog posts on agentic engineering patterns ("Hoard things you know how to do," "Linear walkthroughs," "First run the tests," "Vibe coded presentation app")—core patterns extensively covered Feb 10-24 (harness engineering, sandbox patterns, observability, agent workflows)
- **Gene Kim**: Product catalog pages and sponsorship listings—marketing content without product substance

**Company Updates:**
- **Microsoft/GitHub**: CorpGen research advances (Feb 27)—research announcement without shipped product changes or concrete features
- **Microsoft/GitHub**: Copilot CLI guide (Feb 27)—incremental feature documentation already covered in Feb 24-26 pattern (multi-agent coordination infrastructure)
- **Microsoft/OpenAI**: Joint partnership statement (Feb 27)—organizational announcement without product changes
- **Microsoft/GitHub**: "What's new with GitHub Copilot coding agent" (Feb 26)—incremental feature updates without novel architectural patterns beyond Feb 24-26 coverage
- **Microsoft**: Cloud PC devices announcement (Feb 26)—hardware launch outside AI product scope per `prefs.md`
- **Vercel**: Community moderation with agents (Feb 27)—community management application without product architecture insights
- **Vercel**: Queues beta, Telegram adapter, dashboard features (Feb 27)—infrastructure updates covered by Feb 21 pattern (multimodal infrastructure expansion)
- **Google**: Image generation preview endpoints deprecation (Feb 23, future-dated March 19)—infrastructure notice without product implications

**Deduplication Check:**
All potentially relevant items either:
1. Covered topics already analyzed in depth in previous 14 days (Feb 13-27: multi-agent workflows, observability, memory systems, sandbox architecture, harness engineering, agent frameworks, context engineering, security boundaries, coordination patterns)
2. Lacked concrete details, metrics, or novel insights (generic announcements, marketing content, event listings, research without shipped products, organizational statements)
3. Fell outside PM-relevant scope per `context/prefs.md` filters (hardware launches, partnership statements without product changes, research announcements without product surface area, marketing/sponsorship content)

## This Week's Pattern

**Multi-agent coordination and production reliability infrastructure consolidation.** The week of Feb 24-27 established coordination patterns (orchestration, message-passing, error recovery), observability-evaluation loops, memory systems, and security boundaries as production requirements for agent systems. Today's collected data contained no updates advancing these patterns or introducing fundamentally new product signals.

## Reflection Prompt

This week's research documented the infrastructure layer separating agent prototypes from production systems: coordination patterns prevent multi-agent failures, observability enables continuous improvement, memory transforms agents into learning systems, and security boundaries protect against exploitation.

**For your agent roadmap:** Which infrastructure layer blocks your path to production—coordination (orchestrating multiple agents), observability (understanding agent behavior), memory (agents that improve through usage), or security (isolation and permission controls)? And are you building custom infrastructure for problems frameworks already solved, or adopting proven patterns that let you focus on product differentiation?
