### Lenny Rachitsky - Community Wisdom: Making Your Product Enterprise-Ready
**Source:** https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/p/community-wisdom-making-your-product
**Credibility:** High (community wisdom compilation from experienced PMs and founders)

**What happened:** Lenny published community-sourced advice on making products enterprise-ready—compiling insights from PMs and founders who've navigated the transition from startup product to enterprise-grade platform. The core message: enterprise readiness isn't a feature, it's an operational model.

**Key enterprise readiness patterns:**

**Security and compliance infrastructure:**
- **SOC 2 Type II certification**: Not optional—enterprises won't evaluate without it
- **SSO (Single Sign-On)**: SAML support is table stakes; OAuth alone blocks procurement
- **Role-based access control (RBAC)**: Granular permissions for different user types
- **Audit logs**: Complete activity tracking for compliance and security reviews
- **Data residency options**: Ability to store data in specific regions (EU, US, Asia)

**Operational requirements:**
- **SLA guarantees**: Uptime commitments with financial penalties for breaches
- **Dedicated support channels**: Named support contacts, not ticket queues
- **Custom onboarding**: Tailored implementation plans, not self-service
- **Professional services**: Implementation assistance, training, migration support
- **Success metrics tracking**: Quarterly business reviews showing ROI

**Pricing and packaging changes:**
- **Annual contracts**: Enterprises don't buy monthly subscriptions
- **Volume-based pricing**: Per-seat pricing that scales (with volume discounts)
- **Custom pricing**: Ability to negotiate based on deal size
- **Procurement-friendly terms**: Legal terms that pass vendor risk reviews
- **PO (Purchase Order) support**: Can't require credit cards

**Product architecture adjustments:**
- **Multi-tenancy with data isolation**: Customers can't see each other's data
- **White-labeling capabilities**: Ability to rebrand for large customers
- **API access**: Enterprises integrate; they don't manually input data
- **Deployment flexibility**: Cloud, on-premises, or hybrid options
- **Scalability proof**: Load testing results, uptime history, infrastructure details

**The organizational shift:**
- **Sales process changes**: 3-12 month sales cycles, multiple stakeholders, security reviews
- **Customer success structure**: Dedicated CSMs for accounts over certain size
- **Legal and security teams**: Need in-house expertise to handle enterprise requirements
- **Product roadmap influence**: Enterprise customers expect input on roadmap
- **Support escalation paths**: Clear escalation from L1 support to engineering

**Why the checklist matters more than timing:**
Community consensus: don't build enterprise features speculatively. Build them when you have an enterprise customer willing to commit (verbally or financially) if you deliver. The risk: over-investing in enterprise infrastructure before you've validated enterprise demand.

**The build-vs-buy tradeoff for infrastructure:**
- **SOC 2**: Use compliance automation tools (Vanta, Drata)
- **SSO**: Use auth providers (Auth0, Okta) rather than building
- **Audit logs**: Build early—retrofitting is expensive
- **Data residency**: Architecture decision; can't bolt on later

**Why it matters for PMs:**
This documents the product-market fit cliff between startup and enterprise: your product might work great for SMB customers but be unsellable to enterprises without this infrastructure. For PMs deciding whether to pursue enterprise, the question is: can you build this infrastructure before burn rate becomes critical? The answer determines whether enterprise is viable strategy or distraction.

**Critical questions:**
- What's the minimum viable enterprise readiness? Which items can you defer versus which block all deals?
- How do you validate enterprise demand before investing in infrastructure—LOIs, pilot agreements, or actual contracts?
- What's the cost structure for enterprise infrastructure—one-time build versus ongoing operational expense?
- Does pursuing enterprise create product debt for your startup customer base (complexity, slower iteration)?

**Action you could take today:**
If you're considering enterprise, audit your current product against the checklist above. Count how many requirements you meet today. For missing requirements, estimate: build time, ongoing maintenance cost, and whether it's build-vs-buy. If you meet fewer than 50% and don't have enterprise demand signals, enterprise might be premature. If you meet 80%+ but aren't selling enterprise, you've over-indexed on infrastructure versus product-market fit.

## Quick Hits

**Note:** No additional items met the quality bar today. The collected data contained:
- LangChain posts on memory system implementation and observability-evaluation connections—but these topics were extensively covered Feb 10-21
- Google Vertex AI deprecation notice—infrastructure change without product implications
- Generic blog posts and social media activity without concrete PM signals

## Reflection Prompt

Lenny's community reveals enterprise readiness isn't a feature—it's an operational model requiring SOC 2, SSO, RBAC, audit logs, SLA guarantees, and custom onboarding. But the advice: don't build speculatively; build when an enterprise customer commits if you deliver.

**For your product strategy:** Are you building enterprise features speculatively hoping customers appear—or do you have enterprise demand signals (LOIs, pilot agreements, verbal commits) that justify the infrastructure investment? And if you're already selling to enterprises, which checklist items are you missing that block deals or create operational burden?
