## Items

### Vercel - v0 Coding Agent Effectiveness Improvements
**Source:** https://vercel.com/blog/how-we-made-v0-an-effective-coding-agent

**tl;dr:** Vercel published how they made v0 an effective coding agent, including filesystem-based context retrieval and code reviews that follow project guidelines. Shows practical patterns for building effective AI coding agents.

**What changed:** Vercel released bash-tool for filesystem context retrieval, code reviews that follow project guidelines, and published methodology for making coding agents effective.

**PM Takeaway:**
Effective AI coding agents require better context retrieval methods and alignment with project-specific guidelines, not just better models.

**User problem impacted:**
Developers need AI coding agents that understand project context and follow existing code patterns and guidelines.

**Product surface area:**
Vercel v0 - coding agent architecture, context retrieval tools, and code review systems that align with project guidelines.

**Decision this informs:**
How to structure AI coding agent capabilities, what context retrieval methods to prioritize, and how to ensure agent outputs align with project standards.

**Pattern to note:**
AI coding agents becoming more effective through better context understanding and guideline alignment, not just model improvements.
