# Daily PM Research Update: 2026-01-19

## Summary

Two PM-relevant signals today: Lenny Rachitsky's guide to using Claude Code for PM work shows how AI coding tools enable PMs to conduct research, write, and maintain context more effectively, and LangChain's case study on Remote's customer onboarding reveals practical multi-agent system patterns for real-world production use. Both provide concrete examples of how AI tools change PM workflows and how to structure agent systems for production.
