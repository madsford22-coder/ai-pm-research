## Items

### Anthropic - Demystifying Evals for AI Agents
**Source:** https://www.anthropic.com/engineering

**tl;dr:** Anthropic published guide on evaluating AI agents, covering single-turn versus multi-turn methods and long-term maintenance practices. Addresses evaluation challenges unique to autonomous agents.

**What changed:** Anthropic released comprehensive guide on designing and maintaining evaluation systems for AI agent products.

**PM Takeaway:**
Evaluating AI agents requires combining multiple techniques matching agent complexity, not just extending traditional model evaluation approaches.

**User problem impacted:**
Products need robust evaluation systems to catch agent failures before user impact, especially for autonomous agent behaviors.

**Product surface area:**
AI agent evaluation frameworks, single-turn and multi-turn evaluation methods, and evaluation system maintenance for agent products.

**Decision this informs:**
How to structure evaluation systems for agent products, what evaluation methods to prioritize, and how to maintain evals as agents evolve.

**Pattern to note:**
Companies sharing evaluation frameworks after product quality issues, acknowledging that better evals could have prevented user-facing problems.

### How to Design Evaluation Systems for Autonomous Agents

Anthropic's guide emphasizes that evaluating AI agents requires different approaches than evaluating traditional models, and that insufficient evaluation contributed to Claude Code's product quality issues. For your agent product, how do you design evaluation systems that can catch autonomous agent failures and behavioral issues before they impact users?
