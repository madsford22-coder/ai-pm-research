# Daily PM Research Update: 2026-02-27

## This Week's Pattern

Last week's pattern continues: **Infrastructure and tooling determining agent reliability.** Previous updates documented memory systems (Feb 20-23), harness engineering (Feb 18-19), sandbox architecture (Feb 11-12), and observability-evaluation connections (Feb 23). No new signals emerged today that extend or challenge these patterns.

Microsoft-OpenAI partnership announcement and GitHub Copilot updates represent business continuity, not product evolution. LangChain's production monitoring post reinforces previously documented observability requirements without introducing novel patterns.

## Reflection Prompt

**Prompt for the week:** The past week revealed how memory systems transform agents from stateless tools to learning systems (Feb 20-23), while enterprise adoption is blocked by observability, governance, and security gaps (Feb 12). LangChain showed harness engineering matters more than model improvements (Feb 18-19).

**For your agent roadmap:** If you're building agents, which infrastructure layer is your biggest gap right now—memory (agents that learn from corrections), observability (seeing what agents do), or security/governance (controlling agent actions)? And which gap blocks your next deployment milestone?
