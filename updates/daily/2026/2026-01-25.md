# Daily PM Research Update: 2026-01-25

## One-Line Summary

Lenny's 5-step growth diagnosis framework addresses the perpetual PM challenge of stalled growth, while LangChain's template library shows how platforms reduce agent development friction through ready-to-deploy patterns.

### Lenny Rachitsky - Why Your Product Stopped Growing: 5-Step Framework
**Source:** https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/p/why-your-product-stopped-growing
**Credibility:** High (detailed framework from experienced PM with concrete diagnostic steps)

**What happened:** Lenny published a 5-step framework for diagnosing why products stop growing. The post provides a systematic approach to identifying growth bottlenecks and determining where to focus.

**Key diagnostic patterns:**

**Step 1: Check if growth actually stopped**
Distinguish between seasonal fluctuations and actual stagnation. Look at year-over-year trends, not just recent dips. Many "growth problems" are actually noise.

**Step 2: Identify where in the funnel**
Break growth into components: new user acquisition, activation, retention, resurrection, monetization. Pinpoint which lever stopped working.

**Step 3: Segment the problem**
Growth rarely stops uniformly. Analyze by cohorts, channels, geographies, or user types. Often growth is stalling in specific segments while others still work.

**Step 4: Diagnose the root cause**
Common causes fall into categories: market saturation, product-market fit erosion, competitive pressure, execution quality drops, or external factors. Each requires different fixes.

**Step 5: Test hypotheses systematically**
Run targeted experiments to validate diagnosis before committing resources. Small tests reveal whether the diagnosis is correct.

**Why it matters for PMs:**
Growth diagnosis is a skill rarely taught explicitly. This framework provides a repeatable process for what's often approached ad-hoc. The emphasis on segmentation is particularly useful—aggregate metrics mask where growth actually stopped. For PMs facing stalled metrics, the framework prevents jumping to solutions before understanding the problem.

**Critical questions:**
- How do you distinguish between "growth stopped" versus "growth is just slower"?
- When do you pivot strategy versus doubling down on current approach?
- How long do you diagnose before taking action when pressure is high?

**Action you could take today:**
If your product growth has slowed, apply step 2: map your funnel and identify which specific stage is degrading. Don't rely on top-line metrics alone—break it down to find where the actual bottleneck is.

### LangChain - Agent Builder Template Library Launch
**Source:** https://www.blog.langchain.com/introducing-agent-builder-template-library/
**Credibility:** High (first-party product launch with available templates)

**What happened:** LangChain launched the Agent Builder Template Library—seven pre-built agent templates for common business tasks, plus access to 60+ community templates via Arcade's gallery.

**Available templates:**

1. **Calendar Brief** (Google Calendar) — Daily calendar summaries with participant research
2. **Email Assistant** (Gmail) — Email categorization and draft responses
3. **Incident Responder** (PagerDuty) — Alert analysis with runbook recommendations
4. **Document Intake Review** (Box) — Submission evaluation and summaries
5. **Talent Sourcing** (Exa) — LinkedIn profile searches matching job descriptions
6. **Competitor Research** (Tavily) — Market analysis and reporting
7. **Social Media Monitor** (X + Slack) — Social tracking with daily digests

**Key capabilities:**
- **Model flexibility**: Works with OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini, plus custom models
- **MCP Gateway**: Access to ~8,000 tools for extended functionality
- **Learning from feedback**: Agents improve through user corrections rather than code debugging
- **No-code deployment**: Non-technical users can deploy agents without writing code

**Why it matters for PMs:**
This moves agent development from "build from scratch" to "customize and deploy." For common use cases like email triage or calendar management, time-to-value drops from weeks to hours. The pattern mirrors no-code platform evolution: templates handle 80% of common needs, customization handles edge cases. For PMs evaluating whether to build agents, check the template library first—starting from a template is often faster than starting from zero.

**Critical questions:**
- How much customization do templates allow before you've essentially rebuilt from scratch?
- Templates assume specific integrations (Gmail, PagerDuty)—what if you use alternatives?
- What's the quality difference between template-based agents and custom-built ones?

**Action you could take today:**
Browse the template library. If any template matches 70%+ of a use case you've been considering, prototype with it. Even if you ultimately build custom, the template reveals patterns and edge cases you'd otherwise discover through painful iteration.

### LangChain - Deep Agents Framework for Multi-Agent Systems
**Source:** https://www.blog.langchain.com/building-multi-agent-applications-with-deep-agents/
**Credibility:** Medium (open-source framework with documented patterns, no benchmarks provided)

**What happened:** LangChain released Deep Agents, an open-source framework (MIT licensed) for multi-agent systems built on LangGraph. Inspired by Claude Code, Deep Research, and Manus, it addresses context window constraints through subagents and progressive skill disclosure.

**Key architectural patterns:**

**Subagents (isolated workers):**
- Separate context windows prevent intermediate results from bloating the main agent
- Return only final results to main agent, discarding intermediate work
- Enable different models per agent (cheaper for research, expensive for synthesis)
- Support parallel execution for latency reduction
- Best practice: write detailed descriptions to improve routing decisions

**Skills (progressive capability disclosure):**
- SKILL.md files with YAML frontmatter define capabilities
- Skills load only when invoked—keeps context lean
- Shareable across multiple agents as reusable procedures
- Example: filesystem skill loads full instructions only when file operations needed

**The context bloat problem:**
Research shows models degrade as context windows fill—entering what LangChain calls the "dumb zone." Subagents solve this by isolating work. LangChain claims 67% token reduction in some scenarios, though methodology wasn't provided.

**Why it matters for PMs:**
Context limits are a real constraint forcing architectural choices. If your agent tasks involve long chains of intermediate work, spawning isolated workers that return only final results preserves main agent quality. The skills pattern—loading capabilities on-demand—is analogous to dynamic imports in software: avoid loading everything upfront.

**Critical questions:**
- No benchmarks comparing to CrewAI or AutoGen—how do you evaluate frameworks?
- LangChain's own advice: "Don't rush into multi-agent architectures. Start with a single agent." When is multi-agent actually warranted?
- Skill files add file I/O overhead—at what scale does this matter?

**Action you could take today:**
Before building multi-agent, answer: is my agent hitting context limits? If you're regularly using >50% of context capacity for intermediate results, experiment with spawning isolated subagents. If not, single-agent is simpler and faster.

## This Week's Pattern

**Agent development shifting from code to templates.** LangChain's template library deploys agents in hours. Deep Agents provides multi-agent patterns as reusable components. MCP Gateway offers 8,000 tools without integration work. The shift: differentiate on domain expertise and user experience, not agent infrastructure.

## Reflection Prompt

Lenny's framework emphasizes segmenting growth problems: "Growth rarely stops uniformly—analyze by cohorts, channels, geographies, or user types."

**For your product:** If growth slowed, would your current metrics reveal which segment is stalling? Or would you only see the aggregate decline? How granular would you need to get to pinpoint the actual bottleneck?
