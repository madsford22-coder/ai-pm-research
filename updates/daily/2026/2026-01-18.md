### Lenny's Podcast - The Non-Technical PM's Guide to Building with Cursor
**Source:** https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/p/the-non-technical-pms-guide-to-building-with-cursor
**Credibility:** High (detailed walkthrough from Meta PM who built and shipped products without engineering background)

**What happened:** Zevi Arnovitz, a Meta product manager without a technical background, demonstrated how non-technical builders can create sophisticated, ship-ready products using AI coding tools—specifically Cursor.

**Key techniques described:**

**Multi-Model Strategy:**
Use different AI models for different tasks: "Claude for planning, Gemini for UI." Each model has strengths; matching model to task produces better outputs than using one model for everything.

**Slash Commands for Automation:**
Use Cursor's slash commands to automate repetitive prompts. Once you find a prompt that works, save it as a command to eliminate friction in future sessions.

**AI Peer Review Method:**
Have different AI models review each other's code. This creates a quality-control loop—Claude reviews Gemini's UI code, catching issues a single model might miss.

**Why it matters for PMs:**
This represents a genuine capability shift. Non-technical PMs can now build real products—not just prototypes—without waiting for engineering resources. Arnovitz argues "this is the best time to be a junior in tech" because AI tools democratize technical skills. For PMs, this changes the build-vs-spec calculus: sometimes building is faster than writing a detailed spec and waiting for implementation.

**Critical questions:**
- How much time does a non-technical PM spend learning these tools before becoming productive?
- What's the quality bar for "ship-ready" products built this way vs. traditional engineering?
- When is building yourself faster than working with engineers, and when is it slower?

**Action you could take today:**
Pick a simple internal tool you've been wanting—a dashboard, a status page, a form. Spend 2 hours with Cursor trying to build it. The goal isn't to ship; it's to calibrate how much you can realistically build yourself.

### Lenny Rachitsky - The Future of PM Roles as AI Accelerates Engineering
**Source:** https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/p/how-ai-will-impact-product-management
**Credibility:** High (synthesis of perspectives from multiple product leaders and survey data)

**What happened:** Lenny synthesized how AI is reshaping product management roles. Key data point: Andrew Ng observes that "product management is becoming the new bottleneck" because engineering is accelerating faster than PM work.

**Key insights from recent research:**

**Where PMs see the most AI value (from survey):**
1. Writing PRDs (21.5%)
2. Creating mockups/prototypes (19.8%)
3. Improving communication—emails, presentations (18.5%)

**The role shift underway:**
PMs are increasingly going from idea to prototype without waiting on design (using tools like Lovable, v0). This is a role-boundary shift—PMs doing work that was previously designer-only.

**What won't change:**
- PMs remain the "glue" or "conductor" who tie everything together
- Soft skills (influence, creativity, empathy) become more valuable, not less
- Strategic thinking, vision, and discovery remain high-value and human

**The uncomfortable reality:**
Quoting Anthropic co-founder Ben Mann: "This is as normal as it's going to be. It's going to be much weirder very soon." There's a growing divide between people who understand where things are going and those who don't.

**Why it matters for PMs:**
If engineering accelerates faster than PM work, PMs become the constraint. The response: PMs need to accelerate their own work using AI tools (writing, prototyping, research). The role isn't disappearing, but the skills mix is shifting fast.

**Critical questions:**
- If PMs can prototype directly, how does the PM-designer-engineer triangle change?
- What's the career path for junior PMs when AI handles the tasks they used to learn on?
- How do you stay current when "it's going to be much weirder very soon"?

**Action you could take today:**
Audit where you spend PM time this week. For tasks in the top 3 (PRDs, mockups, communication), have you tried AI acceleration? If not, run an experiment on one.

## Quick Hits

None today—focused day on the Cursor guide and broader PM role implications.

---

## This Week's Pattern

**PM skills shifting from output to orchestration.** Non-technical PMs building products directly. Prototyping moving from designer-only to PM-accessible. AI handling tactical writing. The PM role is becoming more about judgment, strategy, and integration—less about producing artifacts.

## Reflection Prompt

Andrew Ng observes that "product management is becoming the new bottleneck" as engineering accelerates faster than PM work.

**For your PM practice:** Where in your workflow are you the bottleneck? What's preventing you from accelerating as fast as engineering? And what would you do differently if you could prototype and validate ideas directly, without waiting for resources?
