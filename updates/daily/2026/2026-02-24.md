# Daily PM Research Update: 2026-02-24

## Analysis

After reviewing today's collected data against the last 14 days of updates and the quality bar in `context/prefs.md`, no items met the criteria for inclusion:

**People Activity:**
- **Lenny Rachitsky**: Post on "How to use AI for your next job interview" - does not meet PM-relevant criteria (not about product decisions, strategy, or effectiveness improvements)
- **Teresa Torres**: Podcast on "Boundaries Between Product & Engineering" - topic covered extensively in previous updates (Feb 22, Feb 17, Feb 11 on PM craft and team dynamics)
- **Simon Willison**: Posts on "Agentic Engineering Patterns" - appears to be introductory content for a new guide series, lacks concrete implementation details or novel patterns not already covered in previous updates (Feb 23 memory systems, Feb 18-19 harness engineering, Feb 12-13 sandbox patterns)
- **Other tracked people**: No substantive PM-relevant posts within the collection window

**Company Updates:**
- **Replicate**: Seedream 5.0 prompting guide - image generation prompting techniques, not product-relevant (covered under "ignore" criteria: creative AI without product context)
- **Vercel**: Sandbox credential injection - minor infrastructure feature without broader product implications
- **Google**: Claude 3 Haiku deprecation - infrastructure notice without product strategy implications (already covered deprecation patterns in previous updates)
- **Microsoft**: Xbox program and MSSA posts - not AI product-relevant

**Deduplication Check:**
All potentially relevant items either:
1. Covered topics already analyzed in depth in previous 14 days (memory systems, harness engineering, sandbox architecture, PM craft, enterprise readiness)
2. Lacked concrete details, metrics, or novel insights
3. Fell outside PM-relevant scope per `context/prefs.md` filters

## This Week's Pattern

Last week's pattern continues: **Infrastructure and tooling determining agent reliability.** Previous updates documented memory systems (Feb 20-23), harness engineering (Feb 18-19), and sandbox architecture (Feb 11-12). No new signals emerged today that extend or challenge these patterns.

## Reflection Prompt

**Prompt for the week:** The past week revealed how memory systems transform agents from stateless tools to learning systems (Feb 20-23), while enterprise adoption is blocked by observability, governance, and security gaps (Feb 12). LangChain showed harness engineering matters more than model improvements (Feb 18-19).

**For your agent roadmap:** If you're building agents, which infrastructure layer is your biggest gap right now—memory (agents that learn from corrections), observability (seeing what agents do), or security/governance (controlling agent actions)? And which gap blocks your next deployment milestone?
