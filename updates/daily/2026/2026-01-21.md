### Teresa Torres/Product Talk - How ChatGPT Works: Technical Foundations for PMs
**Source:** https://www.producttalk.org/how-does-chatgpt-work/
**Credibility:** High (detailed technical explainer with accessible framing for non-engineers)

**What happened:** Teresa Torres published a comprehensive guide explaining how LLMs work, structured as Input → Black Box → Output. The goal: give PMs enough technical understanding to make informed product decisions.

**Key technical concepts explained:**

**Tokenization & Embeddings:**
Tokens are subword pieces (e.g., "tokenization" = "token" + "ization"). Models use 50,000-100,000 tokens to represent any text. Each token converts to an embedding—a vector representing "a point in n-dimensional space."

**The Attention Mechanism (2017 breakthrough):**
The model generates Query, Key, and Value vectors for each token, comparing them to evaluate relevance. This is why context changes meaning: "great" in "This movie was great" differs from "great" in "This movie was not great."

**Transformer Blocks:**
GPT-3 stacks 96 transformer blocks. Each combines an attention layer that "loads tokens with context" and a neural network layer that "enriches tokens with knowledge."

**Token Prediction:**
Only the final token's enriched embedding determines the next token by comparing it against all vocabulary embeddings.

**Why it matters for PMs:**
Understanding these mechanics reveals why certain product decisions matter: context windows have hard limits, models degrade as context fills, prompt structure directly affects output quality, and "hallucination" is a consequence of probabilistic token prediction, not a bug to be fixed.

**Critical questions:**
- At what context length does your use case hit degradation?
- How does token cost map to your pricing model?
- What prompt structures produce the most consistent outputs for your domain?

**Action you could take today:**
Estimate your product's typical context length in tokens. Use a tokenizer tool (OpenAI's tiktoken, for example) to measure real prompts. If you're regularly using >50% of context capacity, you may be in the degradation zone.

### LangChain - Agent Builder Template Library: Ready-to-Deploy Agents
**Source:** https://www.blog.langchain.com/introducing-agent-builder-template-library/
**Credibility:** Medium (first-party product launch, templates available now)

**What happened:** LangSmith launched an Agent Builder Template Library with prebuilt agents for common business tasks. Seven templates available immediately; Arcade's community gallery adds 60+ more.

**Available templates:**
1. **Calendar Brief** (Google Calendar) — Summarizes daily calendars, researches meeting participants
2. **Email Assistant** (Gmail) — Categorizes emails, drafts responses for approval
3. **Incident Responder** (PagerDuty) — Analyzes alerts, recommends actions from runbooks
4. **Document Intake Review** (Box) — Evaluates submissions, prepares summaries
5. **Talent Sourcing** (Exa) — Searches LinkedIn profiles matching job descriptions
6. **Competitor Research** (Tavily) — Conducts market analysis, delivers reports
7. **Social Media Monitor** (X + Slack) — Tracks social media, sends daily digests

**Key capabilities:**
- **Model flexibility**: Supports OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini, plus custom models
- **MCP Gateway**: Access to ~8,000 tools for expanded functionality
- **Learning from feedback**: Agents improve through user corrections vs. debugging workflows

**Why it matters for PMs:**
Templates shift agent development from "build from scratch" to "customize and deploy." For PMs evaluating agent products, this changes the timeline calculus: common use cases like email triage or calendar summarization are now hours to deploy, not weeks. The MCP Gateway's 8,000 tools also signal that tool ecosystems are becoming differentiators.

**Critical questions:**
- How much customization do templates allow before you've effectively rebuilt from scratch?
- What's the learning curve from "deploy template" to "customize for my domain"?
- Templates assume specific integrations (Gmail, PagerDuty)—what if you use alternatives?

**Action you could take today:**
Before building a custom agent, check if a template exists for your use case. Even if it doesn't match exactly, starting from a template and modifying is often faster than starting from zero.

### GitHub - Copilot CLI Slash Commands: Structured AI Interfaces
**Source:** https://github.blog/ai-and-ml/github-copilot/a-cheat-sheet-to-slash-commands-in-github-copilot-cli/
**Credibility:** High (first-party documentation, commands available now)

**What happened:** GitHub published a comprehensive guide to slash commands in Copilot CLI. These are terminal commands prefixed with `/` that trigger specific, predictable behaviors—unlike natural language prompts.

**Key command categories:**

**Session Management:**
- `/clear` — Reset conversation when switching tasks
- `/usage` — Display usage metrics for auditing

**File & Directory Access:**
- `/add-dir <directory>` — Allow Copilot access to specific directories (security boundary)
- `/cwd [directory]` — Display or change working directory

**Configuration:**
- `/model [model]` — Select different AI models per task
- `/mcp [show|add|edit|delete]` — Manage MCP server connections

**External Services:**
- `/delegate <prompt>` — Create AI-generated pull requests
- `/share [file|gist]` — Export session documentation

**Why structured commands matter:**
- **Predictability**: Unlike prompts, commands "always trigger the same response"
- **Security**: `/add-dir` creates "clear boundaries for file access and an auditable trail"
- **Efficiency**: Run tests, clean errors, get explanations without crafting prompts

**Why it matters for PMs:**
This is a UX pattern worth noting: slash commands provide discoverability that natural language lacks. Users don't have to guess at prompts; they can learn a command vocabulary. For AI tools where predictability matters (developer workflows, enterprise use cases), structured commands may be more valuable than pure natural language flexibility.

**Critical questions:**
- At what point does command vocabulary become overwhelming vs. discoverable?
- How do you teach users commands vs. letting them use natural language?
- Should structured commands and natural language coexist, or does one cannibalize the other?

**Action you could take today:**
If your AI product has recurring use cases, consider whether slash commands (or equivalent structured inputs) would improve user experience. Natural language is flexible but unpredictable; commands are discoverable and consistent.

## This Week's Pattern

**Agent development moving from code to configuration.** LangChain templates deploy in minutes. Slash commands replace custom prompt engineering. MCP Gateway provides 8,000 tools without integration work. The pattern: differentiate on domain expertise and user experience, not agent infrastructure.

## Reflection Prompt

Teresa Torres explains that context windows have hard limits and models degrade as context fills—entering what LangChain calls the "dumb zone."

**For your AI product:** How close to context capacity are your typical user sessions? If you don't know, how would you measure it—and what would you do if degradation is affecting output quality?
