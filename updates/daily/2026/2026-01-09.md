# Daily PM Research Update: 2026-01-09

## Summary

Two PM-relevant signals today: Vercel's guide on building agents with filesystems and bash showing practical patterns for agent architecture and context retrieval, and Dan Shipper's technical guide to building agent-based systems providing concrete implementation patterns for PMs building AI agents. Both reveal practical patterns for agent development beyond just model selection.

## Items

### Vercel - Building Agents with Filesystems and Bash
**Source:** https://vercel.com/blog/how-to-build-agents-with-filesystems-and-bash

**tl;dr:** Vercel published guide on building agents using filesystem operations and bash tools for context retrieval. Shows how to structure agent architectures beyond API calls.

**What changed:** Vercel released technical guide demonstrating agent development patterns using filesystem access and bash tools.

**PM Takeaway:**
Agents need filesystem and shell tool access to effectively retrieve and manipulate project context beyond API-based interactions.

**User problem impacted:**
Developers need agents that can understand and work with local project context through filesystem operations, not just remote APIs.

**Product surface area:**
Agent architecture design, context retrieval systems, and tool integration patterns for AI coding assistants.

**Decision this informs:**
How to structure agent tool capabilities, what context retrieval methods to prioritize, and how to balance API-based versus filesystem-based agent architectures.

**Pattern to note:**
Agent builders expanding beyond API-based tools to include filesystem and shell operations for richer context understanding.

### Dan Shipper - Technical Guide to Building Agent-Based Systems
**Author:** Dan Shipper (Co-founder, Every; Product thinker and builder)
**Source:** https://x.com/danshipper/status/2009651408144835021

**tl;dr:** Dan Shipper published complete technical guide to building agent-based systems. Provides concrete implementation patterns and architectural decisions for PMs building AI agents.

**What changed:** Published comprehensive technical guide covering agent-based system architecture and implementation.

**PM Takeaway:**
Building effective agent-based systems requires specific architectural patterns and implementation strategies beyond just model selection.

**PM problem addressed:**
PMs need concrete technical guidance on agent architecture, tool selection, and implementation patterns when building AI agent products.

**How to apply:**
- Study agent architecture patterns and tool integration strategies
- Apply concrete implementation patterns to agent product development

**Decision this informs:**
How to structure agent product architecture, what tools and capabilities to prioritize, and how to implement agent-based systems effectively.

**Pattern to note:**
PMs and builders sharing concrete technical patterns for agent development as the space matures beyond early experimentation.

## Daily Product Reflection Challenge

### When to Use Filesystem Access vs. API-Based Agent Architecture

Vercel's guide shows agents using filesystem and bash tools for context retrieval, while many agents rely primarily on API calls. For your agent product, how do you decide when to provide filesystem and shell access versus maintaining an API-only architecture, especially considering security and capability tradeoffs?
