## Items

### Marty Cagan - The Product Model at Google
**Source:** https://www.svpg.com/the-product-model-at-google/
**What changed:** Published analysis of how Google structures its product model, including product management practices, team structures, and organizational patterns that enable Google's product development approach.

**PM Takeaway:**
Understanding how a successful tech company structures product work provides frameworks and patterns that PMs can adapt to their own organizations, especially in understanding how product, engineering, and design collaborate.

**PM problem addressed:**
PMs need models for structuring product teams, defining roles, and creating effective product organizations. Many PMs work in organizations without clear product models or struggle to understand how to structure product work at scale.

**How to apply:**
The article provides concrete patterns for how Google structures product teams, defines product manager roles, and enables collaboration between product, engineering, and design. PMs can compare these patterns to their own organizations and identify gaps or opportunities for improvement.

**Decision this informs:**
Organizational design decisions, role definition and hiring, team structure choices, and process improvements. This informs how to structure product work, define PM responsibilities, and create effective product organizations.

**Pattern to note:**
This relates to the open question "How are PM roles, responsibilities, and team structures changing with AI?" - understanding current product models helps identify how they may need to evolve as AI capabilities change product development patterns.

### Google - Deprecating Imagen Fine-Tuning in Favor of Gemini 2.5 Flash Image
**Source:** https://docs.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/models/gemini/2-5-flash-image
**What changed:** Google announced that Imagen subject model and style model fine-tuning will be removed on December 31, 2025, recommending users migrate to Gemini 2.5 Flash Image which supports most use cases that previously required fine-tuning.

**PM Takeaway:**
When a major platform deprecates a capability and recommends a replacement, it signals a shift in the platform's strategy and may indicate that the new approach (base model improvements) is more cost-effective or performant than fine-tuning for many use cases.

**User problem impacted:**
Users who built products relying on Imagen fine-tuning need to migrate, but the migration to Gemini 2.5 Flash Image suggests that base model capabilities may now be sufficient for many use cases that previously required customization. This affects products that invested in fine-tuning workflows.

**Product surface area:**
This impacts any product using Google's Vertex AI for image generation, particularly those that invested in fine-tuning workflows. The deprecation signals a shift toward base model capabilities rather than customization.

**Decision this informs:**
Build vs. buy decisions for AI capabilities - if base models are improving enough to replace fine-tuning, products may need to reconsider investment in fine-tuning infrastructure. Also informs vendor selection and platform commitment decisions.

**Pattern to note:**
This relates to the open question "What's the build vs. buy pattern for AI capabilities in products?" - the deprecation suggests Google is investing more in base model improvements rather than fine-tuning infrastructure, which may indicate a broader industry trend toward better base models vs. customization tools.
