### Lenny Rachitsky - 10 Contrarian Leadership Truths from Rippling CPO
**Source:** https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/p/10-contrarian-leadership-truths
**What changed:** Published interview with Rippling's CPO Matt MacInnis sharing contrarian leadership frameworks, including why to deliberately understaff projects, how to recognize true product-market fit, and frameworks that built a $16B company.

**PM Takeaway:**
Contrarian leadership frameworks from a successful CPO provide actionable insights for PMs on team management, product-market fit recognition, and building effective product organizations.

**PM problem addressed:**
PMs need frameworks for making better leadership decisions, recognizing product-market fit, and structuring teams effectively. Many conventional leadership practices may not work in high-growth product environments.

**How to apply:**
The interview provides specific frameworks including: deliberately understaffing projects (to force prioritization), recognizing true product-market fit (beyond just metrics), and understanding what VCs actually want from product teams. PMs can apply these frameworks to their own team structures and product decisions.

**Decision this informs:**
How to structure product teams, when to recognize product-market fit, how to prioritize resources, and how to align with investor expectations. These frameworks inform organizational design and product strategy decisions.

**Pattern to note:**
Contrarian leadership approaches that challenge conventional wisdom may be more effective in high-growth product environments. This relates to the open question about "How are PM roles, responsibilities, and team structures changing with AI?" - as product organizations evolve, leadership frameworks may need to adapt.
