# Daily PM Research Update: 2025-12-29

## Summary

Two PM-relevant signals today: Lenny Rachitsky's interview with Webflow CPO Rachel Wolan on building a custom AI chief of staff app, and Simon Willison's recent blog posts on AI-assisted development workflows including extracting transcripts from Claude Code and delivering proven code. Both demonstrate practical applications of vibe coding and AI tooling for product work.

### Lenny Rachitsky - How Webflow's CPO Built an AI Chief of Staff
**Author:** Lenny Rachitsky (Former PM at Airbnb; Newsletter author)
**Source:** https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/p/how-webflows-cpo-built-an-ai-chief

**tl;dr:** Webflow's CPO built a custom AI chief-of-staff app for meeting prep and calendar management. PMs can build AI tools tailored to their workflows instead of using generic productivity tools.

**What changed:** Webflow CPO shared how she built a custom AI app that automates calendar management and meeting preparation.

**PM Takeaway:**
PMs can build custom AI tools for their specific workflows rather than adapting generic productivity solutions.

**PM problem addressed:**
Generic productivity tools don't fit PM-specific workflows, limiting effectiveness for time management and meeting prep.

**How to apply:**
- Map repetitive PM tasks (calendar, meeting prep, info synthesis)
- Build custom AI tools or workflows to automate them

**Decision this informs:**
Whether to build custom AI tools vs. buy off-the-shelf solutions for PM workflows.

**Pattern to note:**
PMs are building custom AI tools for their workflows, relating to vibe coding and AI-assisted development trends.

### Simon Willison - Recent AI Development Workflow Posts
**Author:** Simon Willison (Co-creator of Django; Creator of Datasette)
**Source:** https://simonwillison.net

**tl;dr:** Simon Willison published posts on AI-assisted development workflows including transcript extraction and code verification. These show practical techniques for using AI coding tools beyond basic code generation.

**What changed:** Published multiple December 2025 posts on AI-assisted development workflows and techniques.

**PM Takeaway:**
AI coding tools need features beyond code generation, like transcript extraction and verification workflows.

**PM problem addressed:**
PMs lack concrete examples of effective AI coding tool workflows when building or evaluating features.

**How to apply:**
- Prioritize transcript extraction and code verification features
- Evaluate tools based on advanced workflow support

**Decision this informs:**
Which AI coding capabilities to prioritize beyond code generation speed.

**Pattern to note:**
Developers use AI coding tools for learning and verification, not just code generation speed.

## Daily Product Reflection Challenge

### When to Build Custom AI Tools vs. Buy

Webflow's CPO built a custom AI chief-of-staff app for her own workflow instead of using off-the-shelf productivity tools. At what point does the time investment in building custom AI tools for your PM workflow justify the opportunity cost of not using existing solutions?
