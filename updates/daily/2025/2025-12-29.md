# Daily PM Research Update: 2025-12-29

## Summary

Two PM-relevant signals today: Lenny Rachitsky's interview with Webflow CPO Rachel Wolan on building a custom AI chief of staff app, and Simon Willison's recent blog posts on AI-assisted development workflows including extracting transcripts from Claude Code and delivering proven code. Both demonstrate practical applications of vibe coding and AI tooling for product work.

### Lenny Rachitsky - How Webflow's CPO Built an AI Chief of Staff
**Author:** Lenny Rachitsky (Former PM at Airbnb; Newsletter author)
**Source:** https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/p/how-webflows-cpo-built-an-ai-chief

**tl;dr:** Webflow's CPO Rachel Wolan built a custom AI chief-of-staff app that helps prep for meetings, audit her calendar, and level up her entire organization's AI adoption. This is a real-world example of a PM building AI tools to solve their own productivity challenges, demonstrating how AI can augment PM workflows beyond generic tools.

**What changed:** Published interview/video with Webflow CPO Rachel Wolan sharing how she built a custom AI chief-of-staff application that automates calendar management, meeting preparation, and drives AI adoption across her organization. The app helps with practical PM tasks like prepping for meetings, auditing calendar efficiency, and scaling AI usage.

**PM Takeaway:**
A CPO building custom AI tools for her own workflow demonstrates that PMs can create AI-powered solutions tailored to their specific needs, rather than relying solely on generic productivity tools. This shows how AI can augment PM effectiveness when built for specific use cases.

**PM problem addressed:**
PMs struggle with time management, meeting preparation, and driving organizational change (like AI adoption). Generic productivity tools don't always fit PM-specific workflows. Building custom AI tools allows PMs to solve their own productivity challenges with solutions tailored to their specific needs and workflows.

**How to apply:**
PMs can identify repetitive tasks in their workflow (calendar management, meeting prep, information synthesis) and explore building custom AI tools or workflows to automate them. The case study shows how a PM identified specific pain points (calendar efficiency, meeting prep) and built targeted solutions rather than trying to adapt generic tools. PMs can start by mapping their repetitive tasks, then explore AI tools (like custom GPTs, agent workflows, or simple automation) to address them.

**Decision this informs:**
Whether to build custom AI tools vs. using off-the-shelf solutions, how to drive AI adoption in organizations, and how PMs can use AI to improve their own effectiveness. This also informs decisions about investing in AI tooling for PM workflows - the case study suggests custom solutions may be more effective than generic tools for specific PM use cases.

**Pattern to note:**
PMs and product leaders are building custom AI tools for their own workflows rather than relying solely on generic productivity tools. This relates to the new priority area of "vibe coding" and AI-assisted development workflows - PMs are becoming builders of their own tools. This pattern suggests that as AI capabilities improve, PMs may increasingly build custom solutions for their specific needs rather than adapting generic tools. Also relates to the open question "How do AI features change product development velocity?" - if PMs can build their own tools faster, it may accelerate their effectiveness.

### Simon Willison - Recent AI Development Workflow Posts
**Author:** Simon Willison (Co-creator of Django; Creator of Datasette)
**Source:** https://simonwillison.net

**tl;dr:** Simon Willison published several recent blog posts on AI-assisted development workflows, including extracting detailed transcripts from Claude Code sessions and emphasizing the importance of delivering proven code. These posts provide practical insights into how developers and PMs can effectively use AI coding tools in real workflows.

**What changed:** Published multiple blog posts in December 2025 covering AI-assisted development: "A new way to extract detailed transcripts from Claude Code" (Dec 25), "Your job is to deliver code you have proven to work" (Dec 18), "Cooking with Claude" (Dec 23), and "Gemini 3 Flash" (Dec 17). These posts share practical techniques and workflows for using AI coding assistants effectively.

**PM Takeaway:**
Real-world examples of AI-assisted development workflows show how to extract value from AI coding tools beyond basic code generation. The posts demonstrate techniques for getting detailed transcripts from AI coding sessions and emphasize the importance of proving code works, which are relevant patterns for PMs building or evaluating AI-powered development tools.

**PM problem addressed:**
PMs need to understand how developers actually use AI coding tools and what workflows are effective. Many PMs are evaluating or building AI coding features but lack concrete examples of successful patterns. These posts provide real-world techniques that PMs can learn from when designing AI coding features or evaluating tool effectiveness.

**How to apply:**
PMs can use these insights to: (1) understand what developers need from AI coding tools beyond code generation (like transcript extraction for learning and review), (2) design features that help developers prove their code works (testing, verification workflows), (3) evaluate AI coding tools based on whether they support these advanced workflows, and (4) inform product decisions about which AI coding capabilities to prioritize based on real developer needs.

**Decision this informs:**
What features to build in AI coding tools, how to position AI coding capabilities, and what workflows to support. The posts suggest that advanced features like transcript extraction and code verification workflows may be as important as code generation itself. This informs decisions about feature prioritization and product positioning for AI coding tools.

**Pattern to note:**
Developers are finding advanced use cases for AI coding tools beyond simple code generation - extracting transcripts for learning, emphasizing code verification, and building custom workflows. This relates directly to the new priority area of "vibe coding" and new functions for AI-assisted development. The pattern suggests that as AI coding tools mature, the most valuable features may be those that support learning, verification, and workflow integration rather than just code generation speed.
