## Items

### Vercel - Removed 80% of Agent Tools
**Source:** https://vercel.com/blog/we-removed-80-percent-of-our-agents-tools

**tl;dr:** Vercel removed 80% of their agent's tools to improve reliability and reduce complexity. Product removals often reveal more about product strategy than additions.

**What changed:** Vercel removed most agent tools, keeping only essential ones to improve agent performance and reliability.

**PM Takeaway:**
Removing features can improve product quality more than adding them, especially for AI agents where tool complexity hurts reliability.

**User problem impacted:**
Developers need reliable AI agents that complete tasks without errors, not agents with many tools that fail frequently.

**Product surface area:**
Vercel Agent - tool selection and agent reliability improvements through feature reduction.

**Decision this informs:**
How many tools to give AI agents and when to remove features to improve reliability vs. capability.

**Pattern to note:**
Product teams removing AI features to improve reliability, suggesting initial tool proliferation may have been premature.
