### Microsoft - Anthropic Claude Models Added to Foundry Platform
**Source:** https://partner.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/article/azure-updates-december-2025
**What changed:** Microsoft Foundry now offers Anthropic's Claude models, supporting advanced reasoning for research, coding, and agentic workflows within Microsoft's unified governance framework.

**PM Takeaway:**
Microsoft is expanding its AI platform by integrating competitor models (Anthropic's Claude) alongside its own offerings, showing a multi-model strategy for enterprise customers.

**User problem impacted:**
Enterprise customers need access to multiple AI models with different strengths (reasoning, coding, agentic workflows) within a single governance framework, rather than managing separate vendor relationships.

**Product surface area:**
Microsoft Foundry platform - the enterprise AI platform that provides unified access to AI models with governance, security, and compliance controls.

**Decision this informs:**
Whether to offer multiple AI model providers in a platform vs. single-vendor approach. This signals that enterprise customers value choice and unified governance over vendor lock-in, even when it means integrating competitor products.

**Pattern to note:**
Platform providers are moving toward multi-model strategies rather than exclusive partnerships, suggesting customers want to choose the best model for each use case rather than being locked into one provider. This relates to the open question about "build vs buy" patterns - Microsoft is buying/integrating rather than building all models internally.
