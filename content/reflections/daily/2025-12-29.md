# When to Build Custom AI Tools vs. Buy

The time investment in building custom AI tools for a PM workflow is justified when the learning and leverage you gain outweigh both the maintenance burden and the opportunity cost of shipping core product work.

In the current AI landscape, that bar is unusually low. Building lightweight, personal tools is often less about long-term efficiency and more about developing intuition. You learn how models fail, where context breaks down, how prompts drift, and what actually compounds versus what looks clever. That learning has second-order benefits that off-the-shelf tools cannot provide, especially for senior PMs shaping AI strategy rather than just consuming it. This is why examples like Rachel Wolan at Webflow resonate. The tool is useful, but the deeper value is fluency.

The tradeoff flips when the custom system becomes a product you have to run. If the interface demands frequent testing, manual context management, or daily upkeep, you are no longer augmenting your workflow. You are creating a parallel job. At that point, diminishing returns set in quickly. The signal is not complexity alone, but fragility. When small changes break trust or require constant babysitting, off-the-shelf tools regain their advantage.

For senior PMs, the right heuristic is this. Build when the tool is disposable, modular, and teaches you something new. Buy when the tool needs to be durable, polished, and reliably maintained. Early on, breadth through experimentation matters more than depth. Once you understand the patterns, locking yourself into a bespoke interface is often less valuable than staying flexible as the ecosystem evolves.

Net take. Right now, leaning toward learning through building is rational. Just be ruthless about when a personal experiment stops being a learning asset and starts becoming operational drag. That inflection point is where you stop building and start delegating the problem to the market.
