# AI Product Management Research Assistant

System of record and long-term memory for tracking AI product signals and translating them into actionable PM insights.

## Structure

- `context/` - Configuration files that define scope, priorities, and filters
- `updates/` - Daily research updates organized by date
- `research/` - Research prompts and documentation

## Operating Principles

- Prefer shipped product changes over announcements
- Separate facts from interpretation
- Ignore anything that does not meaningfully inform product decisions
- Optimize for PM usefulness, not novelty
