# Research Prompt

## Daily Product Reflection Challenge

### Prompt

Review today's research output in `/research/daily/YYYY-MM-DD.md`. Select one specific, concrete product signal from the day's research—a decision, pattern, or insight that has clear product implications.

Generate a single reflection challenge that:
- Focuses on one specific item (not a summary of multiple items)
- Challenges product judgment and decision-making
- Requires the PM to evaluate a tradeoff, make a call, or assess an approach
- Can be answered in approximately 5 minutes
- Assumes the reader is an experienced PM (no foundational concepts)

The challenge must:
- Have a short title (maximum 8 words)
- Contain one reflection question (not multiple questions or a list)
- Avoid asking for summaries, brainstorming, or abstract philosophy
- Force a concrete judgment call or decision evaluation

Format the challenge as follows:

```
## [Short Title - Max 8 Words]

[One reflection question that challenges product judgment]

Complete your reflection in `/reflections/daily/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
```
